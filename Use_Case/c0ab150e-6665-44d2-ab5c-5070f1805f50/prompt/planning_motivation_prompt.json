While Event Segmentation Theory (EST) provides a cognitive foundation, its computational implementation in prior online methods such as ESTimator is limited. This paper presents \\textbf{ESTimator++}, a significantly enhanced framework that advances the original through a more systematic instantiation of EST. Our key contributions are threefold: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer boundary signals; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} which replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned decision function.

Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, with the AMTD providing the most significant single-module gain (+2.9\\%). Remarkably, this is achieved while maintaining high efficiency at \\textbf{8.2 ms per frame}. Our work demonstrates that a principled, integrated design substantially advances the performance of online event segmentation.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe proliferation of long-form video content on platforms like YouTube and Netflix has created a pressing need for advanced video understanding systems. While tasks such as action recognition are well-established, they predominantly focus on short, trimmed clips with predefined labels. In contrast, the analysis of untrimmed, long-form videos containing complex narratives remains a formidable challenge. Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) tackles this issue by aiming to segment videos into taxonomy-free, semantically coherent units, thereby emulating the human ability to parse continuous visual streams.\n\nCurrent GEBD frameworks operate in an \\textit{offline} manner. They process an entire video segment in one pass, leveraging both past and future context to identify all boundaries simultaneously. This paradigm stands in stark contrast to human perception, which segments events \\textit{online}—sequentially and causally, relying solely on past and present information without any access to future content. To bridge this fundamental gap and more faithfully replicate human cognitive processes, we introduce a novel and more demanding task: \\textbf{Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD)}. In this setting, a model must process a video stream and make immediate, frame-by-frame decisions regarding boundary occurrences, using only historical and current data.\n\nOn-GEBD inherits the inherent challenges of offline GEBD, such as detecting subtle and taxonomy-free transitions, but introduces additional complexities due to its strictly causal and information-limited nature. Existing offline GEBD methods, which often depend on global temporal context through mechanisms like similarity matrices or multi-frame comparisons, are fundamentally incompatible with the online setting. Likewise, naïvely adapting models designed for other online action understanding tasks proves ineffective, as they are not tailored for the fine-grained detection of generic boundaries.\n\nTo address these unique challenges, we propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced online framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) from cognitive science. EST suggests that humans continuously predict upcoming visual input based on an ongoing event model and perceive a boundary when a significant prediction error arises. Our framework operationalizes this principle through three core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer} that maintains a stable representation of the current event for robust future anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error} mechanism that derives a richer and more stable discrepancy signal; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator}, a lightweight network that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-aware decision function. These components are integrated under a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss} that jointly enforces prediction accuracy and temporal coherence.\n\nExtensive experiments on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD. It significantly surpasses all adapted online baselines and, remarkably, achieves performance competitive with many sophisticated offline methods, despite operating under a strict causal constraint. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each proposed component. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we review related work, detail our methodology, present comprehensive experimental results, and provide concluding remarks.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\subsection{Generic Event Boundary Detection}\nGeneric Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify boundaries that align with human perceptual segmentation within untrimmed videos, operating without a predefined taxonomy of events. This task differs from traditional video understanding tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and Action Recognition, as GEBD handles continuous, open-ended semantics. Recent advancements in offline GEBD typically process entire videos or extensive temporal contexts. Representative methods include UBoCo, which leverages temporal similarity matrices with contrastive learning; DDM-Net, which applies progressive attention on multi-level dense difference maps; and CoSeg, which introduces a reconstruction-based objective inspired by cognitive modeling. While these offline methods have shown progress, they are not designed for streaming video. Our work adapts GEBD to the \\textit{online} setting, requiring instantaneous decisions without access to future frames.\n\n\\subsection{Video Understanding}\nVideo understanding encompasses tasks such as Temporal Action Detection (TAD), Temporal Action Localization (TAL), and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). State-of-the-art approaches often employ transformer architectures, memory mechanisms, and end-to-end frameworks. A common limitation is their reliance on a closed set of predefined action classes, which restricts applicability in open-world scenarios. Although open-set formulations for TAL exist, they focus on localizing and classifying known actions. In contrast, GEBD detects boundaries for taxonomy-free events, providing a more general approach to video structure understanding.\n\n\\subsection{Online Video Understanding}\nOnline video understanding methods process data in a streaming fashion, sharing core challenges with Online GEBD (On-GEBD). Relevant tasks include Online Action Detection (OAD), Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), and Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS). For OAD, recent works such as LSTR, TeSTra, and MiniROAD demonstrate the efficacy of transformers and recurrent units. For On-TAL, methods like CAG-QIL and OAT have been proposed. While ODAS shares an online nature with On-GEBD, it is designed for a fixed set of action categories. Conversely, On-GEBD must detect subtle, categorical changes between taxonomy-free events, necessitating a distinct methodological approach from conventional online action-centric models.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur enhanced framework, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, extends the original ESTimator by providing a more systematic computational implementation of Event Segmentation Theory (EST). While retaining the core principle of using prediction discrepancy for online boundary detection, ESTimator++ introduces three key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation, (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer and more stable boundary cues, and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-sensitive decision function. These components are unified during training via a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which enforces both local prediction accuracy and global temporal coherence.\n\n\\subsection{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer for Consistent Event Anticipation (HMT-CEA)}\nThe original Consistent Event Anticipation (CEA) employs a standard transformer decoder with a limited look-back window, which may fail to maintain a persistent representation of an ongoing event's gist. Inspired by human cognition—which uses working memory for immediate context and long-term memory for schemas—we propose the HMT-CEA. It maintains two complementary memory structures: a dynamic \\textbf{Main Event Memory ($\\mathbf{M}$)} that captures the abstract, persistent essence of the current event, and a \\textbf{Local Context Cache ($\\mathbf{C}$)} that holds fine-grained recent features.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture and State Update}\nGiven a stream of frame features $\\mathbf{f}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, we first project them into a memory-compatible space: $\\mathbf{h}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{f}_t)$. The HMT-CEA operates recurrently, maintaining states $(\\mathbf{M}_t, \\mathbf{C}_t)$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Local Context Update}: The cache $\\mathbf{C}_t$ is a FIFO queue of the last $L$ projected features: $\\mathbf{C}_t = [\\mathbf{h}_{t-L}, ..., \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}]$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Main Memory Gated Update}: The core memory $\\mathbf{M}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ is updated via a gated mechanism using the new observation $\\mathbf{h}_t$ and previous context.\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g [\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}; \\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t; \\mathbf{h}_t] + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t = \\text{TransformerBlock}(\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_t, \\mathbf{h}_t)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{M}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t + (1 - \\mathbf{g}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\n    \\]\n    where $\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t$ is the mean-pooled cache, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\\text{TransformerBlock}$ is a lightweight cross-attention module that allows the memory to attend to the local context and new input.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Next-Frame Prediction}: The anticipated feature for frame $t$ is generated by fusing information from both memory levels:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{z}_t = \\text{Decoder}( \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_{t-1} )\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{z}_t)\n    \\]\n    Here, $\\text{Decoder}$ is a small autoregressive transformer that uses $\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}$ as a persistent query and $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ as keys and values, ensuring causality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis architecture ensures predictions are grounded in both the immediate past ($\\mathbf{C}$) and a stable, evolving representation of the current event ($\\mathbf{M}$).\n\n\\subsection{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nInstead of a single scalar error, we define a multi-dimensional error vector $\\mathbf{E}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that captures different facets of prediction inconsistency, yielding a more robust boundary detection signal.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error ($E^{(r)}_t$)}: The primary discrepancy, analogous to the original $\\epsilon_t$, but computed in the projected space for stability.\n    \\[\n    E^{(r)}_t = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{h}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_t}{\\|\\mathbf{h}_t\\| \\|\\mathbf{z}_t\\|}\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error ($E^{(s)}_t$)}: Measures inconsistency between consecutive predictions. Within a consistent event, predictions should vary smoothly.\n    \\[\n    E^{(s)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|_2 - \\beta \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{h}_t - \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\\|_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\beta$ is a scaling factor. This term becomes large only when predictions are jagged despite smooth actual changes.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error ($E^{(m)}_t$)}: Quantifies the impact of the new frame on the main event memory, reflecting a potential high-level schema violation.\n    \\[\n    E^{(m)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{M}_t - \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\\|_1\n    \\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe final SMPE vector is the concatenation: $\\mathbf{E}_t = [E^{(r)}_t, E^{(s)}_t, E^{(m)}_t]^\\top$. This structured error is more informative and less noisy than a scalar counterpart.\n\n\\subsection{Training with Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}\nThe HMT-CEA is trained by minimizing a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which jointly optimizes prediction accuracy and the temporal structural properties implied by EST.\n\n\\subsubsection{Boundary-Aware Focal Reconstruction Loss}\nWe adapt binary cross-entropy to address class imbalance and hard examples using the primary error $E^{(r)}_t$:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{Focal}(E^{(r)}_t, y_t) = - \\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma y_t \\log(p_t) - (1 - \\alpha) p_t^\\gamma (1 - y_t) \\log(1 - p_t)\n\\]\nwhere $p_t = \\text{sigmoid}(-\\lambda \\cdot E^{(r)}_t + b)$, $\\lambda$ and $b$ are learnable parameters, $y_t$ is the boundary label, $\\alpha$ balances class frequency, and $\\gamma$ focuses on hard examples.\n\n\\subsubsection{Temporal Coherence Regularization}\nThis unsupervised loss enforces two structural properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Prediction Smoothness}: Within non-boundary segments ($y_t=0$), predictions should be smooth:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of non-boundary frames.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Feature Clustering}: All predictions within a ground-truth event segment should cluster in embedding space:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster} = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\frac{1}{|I_s|} \\sum_{i \\in I_s} \\|\\mathbf{z}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $S$ is the number of events in a clip, $I_s$ is the set of frame indices in event $s$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s$ is the mean of $\\mathbf{z}_i$ for $i \\in I_s$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe total SCL is: $\\mathcal{L}_{SCL} = \\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\lambda_s \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} + \\lambda_c \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$.\n\n\\subsection{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)}\nThe AMTD replaces the heuristic online boundary detector (OBD) with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) that learns to detect boundaries from the sequence of SMPE vectors $\\{\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t\\}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture}\nThe AMTD, denoted $\\mathcal{D}_\\phi$, comprises:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-scale Feature Extraction}: Parallel 1D convolutions with kernel sizes $k_1, k_2, k_3$ capture short-, medium-, and long-range temporal patterns in $\\mathbf{E}_t$:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{s}^{(i)}_t = \\text{ReLU}(\\text{Conv1D}_{k_i}([\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t]))\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Dynamic Fusion}: Multi-scale features are concatenated and weighted adaptively via self-attention:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{S}_t = [\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(2)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(3)}_t], \\quad \\mathbf{A}_t = \\text{SelfAttention}(\\mathbf{S}_t)\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Boundary Probability Estimation}: The attended feature produces the final online boundary probability:\n    \\[\n    P_t^{boundary} = \\sigma(\\text{MLP}(\\text{Pool}(\\mathbf{A}_t)))\n    \\]\n    A boundary is declared if $P_t^{boundary} > 0.5$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsubsection{Online Operation and Training}\nDuring online inference, AMTD slides over the streaming SMPE vectors using a FIFO buffer of size $\\Delta+1$. It is trained jointly with the HMT-CEA via SCL, where binary labels $y_t$ supervise $P_t^{boundary}$ through a standard cross-entropy loss, forming a fully differentiable, end-to-end optimizable system for online granular event boundary detection (On-GEBD).\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\subsubsection{Benchmark Datasets.}\nWe evaluate our method on two established benchmarks for generic event boundary detection (GEBD). The \\textbf{Kinetics-GEBD} dataset is derived from the Kinetics-400 dataset, comprising approximately 60K videos. Each video is annotated with taxonomy-free event boundaries, containing about five events on average. The dataset is officially split into training (18,794 videos), validation (18,813 videos), and test (17,725 videos) sets. As test set annotations are withheld, we report results on the validation set, consistent with prior work. For cross-validation in certain analyses, we further split the training data into 80\\% for training and 20\\% for validation. The \\textbf{TAPOS} dataset consists of Olympic sports videos originally annotated for action localization. Following the standard adaptation for GEBD, we repurpose it by discarding action labels and treating sub-action boundaries as generic event boundaries. This results in 13,094 training and 1,790 validation action instances.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evaluation Metric.}\nWe adopt the standard Relative Distance (Rel.Dis) metric for GEBD. For a predicted boundary timestamp and its corresponding ground truth, the relative distance is computed as their temporal offset divided by the duration of the union of the predicted and ground-truth event instances. Following common practice, when multiple consecutive frames are predicted as boundaries, the central frame is taken as the final timestamp. Performance is evaluated under ten Rel.Dis thresholds from 0.05 to 0.5 with a step size of 0.05. A prediction is considered correct if its Rel.Dis is below a given threshold. We report the F1 score at each threshold and the average F1 score across all thresholds.\n\n\\subsubsection{Baselines.}\nEstablishing baselines for Online GEBD (On-GEBD) is non-trivial as standard offline GEBD methods are not designed for streaming input. Therefore, we adapt state-of-the-art models from related online video understanding tasks. From Online Action Detection, we adapt TeSTra, OadTR, and MiniROAD. From Online Temporal Action Localization, we adapt Sim-On. For a fair comparison, we modify only the final layer of each model to perform binary classification (boundary vs. non-boundary), denoted with the suffix '-BC'. We also compare against a dedicated online GEBD method, \\textbf{ESTimator}. Furthermore, to contextualize our online performance, we include comparisons with leading offline GEBD methods.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implementation Details.}\nOur proposed method, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, is implemented using standard video features for fair comparison. Videos are sampled at 24 FPS for Kinetics-GEBD and 6 FPS for TAPOS. We use 2048-dimensional features extracted by an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 encoder. The Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) employs a main memory with dimension $d_m=512$ and a local context cache of size $L=16$. The Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) uses temporal convolutional kernels of sizes $[3, 7, 15]$. The model is trained end-to-end for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $1\\times10^{-4}$, a batch size of 512, and loss weights $\\lambda_s=0.1$ and $\\lambda_c=0.05$.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison with Online Baselines}\nTable~\\ref{tab:online_k400} and Table~\\ref{tab:online_tapos} present the online detection performance on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS validation sets, respectively.\n\nOn Kinetics-GEBD (Table~\\ref{tab:online_k400}), \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming all online baselines across all Rel.Dis thresholds. Traditional online models like TeSTra-BC and Sim-On-BC show limited effectiveness for this task. While MiniROAD-BC and the prior dedicated method ESTimator perform better, our method achieves a superior average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}. This represents an improvement of +3.0\\% over ESTimator and +9.7\\% over MiniROAD-BC, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed architectural components.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Quantitative comparison with online baselines on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set.

We profile the average inference time per frame on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:efficiency}, \\textbf{ESTimator++} processes frames at \\textbf{8.2 ms (∼122 FPS)}, which is significantly faster than the real-time requirement of 24 FPS for the Kinetics dataset. Although it is understandably slower than the simpler ESTimator and some lightweight baselines like TeSTra-BC, its runtime is still an order of magnitude lower than the total latency of offline methods, which must process entire clips. This demonstrates that \\textbf{ESTimator++} successfully balances state-of-the-art accuracy with practical online inference speed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of inference efficiency (lower time per frame is better).

This can be attributed to the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) providing a cleaner signal and the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) learning to distinguish true boundary patterns from noise. Furthermore, in sequences with gradual transitions, \\textbf{ESTimator++} shows improved temporal localization, likely due to the multi-scale receptive field of the AMTD. These observations align with its superior quantitative performance.\n\n\\section{Ablation Studies}\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set to validate the contribution of each component in \\textbf{ESTimator++}. All experiments follow the implementation details in Section~\\ref{sec:setup}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Impact of Proposed Components}\nWe start from a baseline model that uses a standard Transformer decoder for prediction and a single reconstruction error with a fixed heuristic threshold for detection. This baseline achieves an average F1 score of 0.715. We then sequentially integrate our proposed components, with results summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_components}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation study on the contribution of each proposed component. Evaluated on Kinetics-GEBD validation set (Average F1). $\\Delta$ denotes the improvement over the previous row.}\n\\label{tab:ablation_components}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Variant} & \\textbf{HMT} & \\textbf{SMPE} & \\textbf{SCL} & \\textbf{AMTD} & \\textbf{Avg F1} & $\\Delta$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nBaseline (ESTimator Core) & & & & & 0.715 & -- \\\\\n+ Hierarchical Memory (HMT) & \\checkmark & & & & 0.733 & +0.018 \\\\\n+ Structured Error (SMPE) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & & 0.754 & +0.021 \\\\\n+ Consistency Loss (SCL) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & 0.769 & +0.015 \\\\\n+ Adaptive Discriminator (AMTD) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\textbf{0.778} & \\textbf{+0.029} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nIntegrating the \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} improves performance by +1.8\\%, demonstrating the importance of maintaining stable event context for consistent prediction. Replacing the single error with the \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} yields a further gain of +2.1\\%, confirming that a composite error signal provides richer boundary cues. Employing the \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)} for training adds another +1.5\\%, validating that enforcing intra-event smoothness and feature clustering shapes more discriminative representations. Finally, substituting the heuristic threshold with the learned \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} provides the most substantial single-module improvement of +2.9\\%, underscoring the advantage of a data-driven decision function. The full model integrating all components achieves the best performance of \\textbf{0.778}, confirming their synergistic effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{Analysis of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nWe analyze the contribution of each error view within the SMPE by ablating them individually from the full model. Results are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_smpe}. Removing the \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error} causes the most significant drop (-1.7\\% in Avg F1), highlighting its sensitivity to event transitions. Omitting the \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error} leads to a -1.2\\% decrease, demonstrating the importance of tracking high-level event schema changes. Removing the primary \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error} also degrades performance (-1.0\\%). Using any single error view consistently underperforms compared to the full SMPE vector, validating our composite design.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE).

Results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_amtd}. Replacing the AMTD with the original heuristic Online Boundary Detector (OBD) causes a performance drop to 0.748. Using a \\textbf{single-scale} Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) instead of the multi-scale architecture reduces Avg F1 to 0.771. Removing the \\textbf{self-attention based dynamic fusion} and simply concatenating multi-scale features results in a score of 0.774. These ablations confirm that each aspect of the AMTD's design—its learned nature, multi-scale perception, and adaptive fusion—contributes to its effectiveness.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the design of the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD).

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_loss}, training with only the \\textbf{Focal Reconstruction Loss} yields a baseline score of 0.754. Adding the \\textbf{Intra-event Smoothness Loss} improves performance to 0.766. Further incorporating the \\textbf{Intra-event Clustering Loss} to form the full SCL pushes the score to 0.769. The full SCL, combining both regularizers, delivers the best result, confirming that jointly optimizing for local accuracy and global temporal coherence is an effective strategy.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL). The HMT and SMPE are used in all variants.

The hierarchical memory (HMT) establishes a robust predictive foundation, the structured error (SMPE) extracts optimal boundary cues, the consistency loss (SCL) shapes the learning objective, and the adaptive discriminator (AMTD) makes precise online decisions. The full model's superior performance arises from their seamless integration.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\subsection{Training Dynamics and Convergence Analysis}\nTo gain deeper insights into the optimization behavior of \\textbf{ESTimator++}, we analyze its training dynamics. The training and validation loss curves over 30 epochs on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset show that \\textbf{ESTimator++} converges more smoothly and stably to a lower final loss compared to its predecessor \\textbf{ESTimator} and the strong baseline \\textbf{MiniROAD-BC}. This indicates that the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL) provides a more stable gradient signal. Furthermore, the gap between training and validation loss for \\textbf{ESTimator++} remains consistently narrow, suggesting strong generalization and reduced overfitting, a benefit likely attributable to the regularizing effects of $\\mathcal{L}_{Smooth}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$. In contrast, the baseline models exhibit more pronounced fluctuations and a larger generalization gap.\n\n\\subsection{In-depth Case Study}\nWe conduct a systematic case study to examine \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s performance across diverse scenarios. We categorize sequences from the Kinetics-GEBD validation set into groups such as \\textit{‘fast-paced action transitions’}, \\textit{‘gradual scene changes’}, and \\textit{‘static periods with subtle motions’}. For each category, we compare the SMPE signal and final boundary predictions from \\textbf{ESTimator++} against those from \\textbf{ESTimator} and \\textbf{TeSTra-BC}. In fast-paced sequences, \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s AMTD demonstrates superior ability to isolate closely spaced peaks, leading to precise detection of sequential boundaries. For gradual transitions, the multi-view SMPE provides a rising error signal over several frames, which the multi-scale AMTD effectively integrates to produce a confident prediction. During static periods, \\textbf{ESTimator++} exhibits significantly lower spurious activation due to the intra-event smoothness constraint. These observations concretely explain the quantitative improvements shown in the main results.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis paper addresses the task of Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD). We propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced framework that provides a deeper computational implementation of the Event Segmentation Theory (EST). It integrates three key innovations: a Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) for robust event anticipation, a Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) for richer boundary cues, and an Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) for learning boundary decisions. These components are trained end-to-end using a novel Structural Consistency Loss (SCL).\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the Kinetics-GEBD dataset, \\textbf{ESTimator++} achieves a state-of-the-art average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}, significantly outperforming all existing online baselines, including its predecessor ESTimator (0.748). Similarly, on the TAPOS dataset, it attains a leading average F1 score of \\textbf{0.569}. Notably, our online method performs competitively against many powerful offline models, securing the third-highest overall ranking on both benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, with AMTD yielding the most substantial gain as a single module. Furthermore, \\textbf{ESTimator++} maintains a practical inference time of 8.2ms per frame, making it suitable for real-time processing.\n\nIn summary, \\textbf{ESTimator++} establishes a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD by effectively translating cognitive principles into a synergistic neural architecture. It delivers highly accurate boundary detection with low latency, paving the way for more sophisticated real-time video understanding systems. Future work could explore extending this framework to more complex, long-form video streams and multi-modal inputs.\n\n\\end{document}\n\nPlease generate a professional image generation prompt according to the figure type."

This paper presents \\textbf{ESTimator++}, a significantly enhanced framework that advances the original through a more systematic instantiation of EST. Our key contributions are threefold: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer boundary signals; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} which replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned decision function.

Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, with the AMTD providing the most significant single-module gain (+2.9\\%). Remarkably, this is achieved while maintaining high efficiency at \\textbf{8.2 ms per frame}. Our work demonstrates that a principled, integrated design substantially advances the performance of online event segmentation.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe proliferation of long-form video content on platforms like YouTube and Netflix has created a pressing need for advanced video understanding systems. While tasks such as action recognition are well-established, they predominantly focus on short, trimmed clips with predefined labels. In contrast, the analysis of untrimmed, long-form videos containing complex narratives remains a formidable challenge. Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) tackles this issue by aiming to segment videos into taxonomy-free, semantically coherent units, thereby emulating the human ability to parse continuous visual streams.\n\nCurrent GEBD frameworks operate in an \\textit{offline} manner. They process an entire video segment in one pass, leveraging both past and future context to identify all boundaries simultaneously. This paradigm stands in stark contrast to human perception, which segments events \\textit{online}—sequentially and causally, relying solely on past and present information without any access to future content. To bridge this fundamental gap and more faithfully replicate human cognitive processes, we introduce a novel and more demanding task: \\textbf{Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD)}. In this setting, a model must process a video stream and make immediate, frame-by-frame decisions regarding boundary occurrences, using only historical and current data.\n\nOn-GEBD inherits the inherent challenges of offline GEBD, such as detecting subtle and taxonomy-free transitions, but introduces additional complexities due to its strictly causal and information-limited nature. Existing offline GEBD methods, which often depend on global temporal context through mechanisms like similarity matrices or multi-frame comparisons, are fundamentally incompatible with the online setting. Likewise, naïvely adapting models designed for other online action understanding tasks proves ineffective, as they are not tailored for the fine-grained detection of generic boundaries.\n\nTo address these unique challenges, we propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced online framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) from cognitive science. EST suggests that humans continuously predict upcoming visual input based on an ongoing event model and perceive a boundary when a significant prediction error arises. Our framework operationalizes this principle through three core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer} that maintains a stable representation of the current event for robust future anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error} mechanism that derives a richer and more stable discrepancy signal; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator}, a lightweight network that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-aware decision function. These components are integrated under a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss} that jointly enforces prediction accuracy and temporal coherence.\n\nExtensive experiments on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD. It significantly surpasses all adapted online baselines and, remarkably, achieves performance competitive with many sophisticated offline methods, despite operating under a strict causal constraint. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each proposed component. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we review related work, detail our methodology, present comprehensive experimental results, and provide concluding remarks.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\subsection{Generic Event Boundary Detection}\nGeneric Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify boundaries that align with human perceptual segmentation within untrimmed videos, operating without a predefined taxonomy of events. This task differs from traditional video understanding tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and Action Recognition, as GEBD handles continuous, open-ended semantics. Recent advancements in offline GEBD typically process entire videos or extensive temporal contexts. Representative methods include UBoCo, which leverages temporal similarity matrices with contrastive learning; DDM-Net, which applies progressive attention on multi-level dense difference maps; and CoSeg, which introduces a reconstruction-based objective inspired by cognitive modeling. While these offline methods have shown progress, they are not designed for streaming video. Our work adapts GEBD to the \\textit{online} setting, requiring instantaneous decisions without access to future frames.\n\n\\subsection{Video Understanding}\nVideo understanding encompasses tasks such as Temporal Action Detection (TAD), Temporal Action Localization (TAL), and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). State-of-the-art approaches often employ transformer architectures, memory mechanisms, and end-to-end frameworks. A common limitation is their reliance on a closed set of predefined action classes, which restricts applicability in open-world scenarios. Although open-set formulations for TAL exist, they focus on localizing and classifying known actions. In contrast, GEBD detects boundaries for taxonomy-free events, providing a more general approach to video structure understanding.\n\n\\subsection{Online Video Understanding}\nOnline video understanding methods process data in a streaming fashion, sharing core challenges with Online GEBD (On-GEBD). Relevant tasks include Online Action Detection (OAD), Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), and Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS). For OAD, recent works such as LSTR, TeSTra, and MiniROAD demonstrate the efficacy of transformers and recurrent units. For On-TAL, methods like CAG-QIL and OAT have been proposed. While ODAS shares an online nature with On-GEBD, it is designed for a fixed set of action categories. Conversely, On-GEBD must detect subtle, categorical changes between taxonomy-free events, necessitating a distinct methodological approach from conventional online action-centric models.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur enhanced framework, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, extends the original ESTimator by providing a more systematic computational implementation of Event Segmentation Theory (EST). While retaining the core principle of using prediction discrepancy for online boundary detection, ESTimator++ introduces three key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation, (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer and more stable boundary cues, and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-sensitive decision function. These components are unified during training via a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which enforces both local prediction accuracy and global temporal coherence.\n\n\\subsection{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer for Consistent Event Anticipation (HMT-CEA)}\nThe original Consistent Event Anticipation (CEA) employs a standard transformer decoder with a limited look-back window, which may fail to maintain a persistent representation of an ongoing event's gist. Inspired by human cognition—which uses working memory for immediate context and long-term memory for schemas—we propose the HMT-CEA. It maintains two complementary memory structures: a dynamic \\textbf{Main Event Memory ($\\mathbf{M}$)} that captures the abstract, persistent essence of the current event, and a \\textbf{Local Context Cache ($\\mathbf{C}$)} that holds fine-grained recent features.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture and State Update}\nGiven a stream of frame features $\\mathbf{f}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, we first project them into a memory-compatible space: $\\mathbf{h}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{f}_t)$. The HMT-CEA operates recurrently, maintaining states $(\\mathbf{M}_t, \\mathbf{C}_t)$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Local Context Update}: The cache $\\mathbf{C}_t$ is a FIFO queue of the last $L$ projected features: $\\mathbf{C}_t = [\\mathbf{h}_{t-L}, ..., \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}]$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Main Memory Gated Update}: The core memory $\\mathbf{M}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ is updated via a gated mechanism using the new observation $\\mathbf{h}_t$ and previous context.\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g [\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}; \\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t; \\mathbf{h}_t] + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t = \\text{TransformerBlock}(\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_t, \\mathbf{h}_t)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{M}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t + (1 - \\mathbf{g}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\n    \\]\n    where $\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t$ is the mean-pooled cache, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\\text{TransformerBlock}$ is a lightweight cross-attention module that allows the memory to attend to the local context and new input.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Next-Frame Prediction}: The anticipated feature for frame $t$ is generated by fusing information from both memory levels:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{z}_t = \\text{Decoder}( \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_{t-1} )\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{z}_t)\n    \\]\n    Here, $\\text{Decoder}$ is a small autoregressive transformer that uses $\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}$ as a persistent query and $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ as keys and values, ensuring causality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis architecture ensures predictions are grounded in both the immediate past ($\\mathbf{C}$) and a stable, evolving representation of the current event ($\\mathbf{M}$).\n\n\\subsection{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nInstead of a single scalar error, we define a multi-dimensional error vector $\\mathbf{E}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that captures different facets of prediction inconsistency, yielding a more robust boundary detection signal.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error ($E^{(r)}_t$)}: The primary discrepancy, analogous to the original $\\epsilon_t$, but computed in the projected space for stability.\n    \\[\n    E^{(r)}_t = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{h}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_t}{\\|\\mathbf{h}_t\\| \\|\\mathbf{z}_t\\|}\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error ($E^{(s)}_t$)}: Measures inconsistency between consecutive predictions. Within a consistent event, predictions should vary smoothly.\n    \\[\n    E^{(s)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|_2 - \\beta \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{h}_t - \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\\|_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\beta$ is a scaling factor. This term becomes large only when predictions are jagged despite smooth actual changes.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error ($E^{(m)}_t$)}: Quantifies the impact of the new frame on the main event memory, reflecting a potential high-level schema violation.\n    \\[\n    E^{(m)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{M}_t - \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\\|_1\n    \\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe final SMPE vector is the concatenation: $\\mathbf{E}_t = [E^{(r)}_t, E^{(s)}_t, E^{(m)}_t]^\\top$. This structured error is more informative and less noisy than a scalar counterpart.\n\n\\subsection{Training with Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}\nThe HMT-CEA is trained by minimizing a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which jointly optimizes prediction accuracy and the temporal structural properties implied by EST.\n\n\\subsubsection{Boundary-Aware Focal Reconstruction Loss}\nWe adapt binary cross-entropy to address class imbalance and hard examples using the primary error $E^{(r)}_t$:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{Focal}(E^{(r)}_t, y_t) = - \\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma y_t \\log(p_t) - (1 - \\alpha) p_t^\\gamma (1 - y_t) \\log(1 - p_t)\n\\]\nwhere $p_t = \\text{sigmoid}(-\\lambda \\cdot E^{(r)}_t + b)$, $\\lambda$ and $b$ are learnable parameters, $y_t$ is the boundary label, $\\alpha$ balances class frequency, and $\\gamma$ focuses on hard examples.\n\n\\subsubsection{Temporal Coherence Regularization}\nThis unsupervised loss enforces two structural properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Prediction Smoothness}: Within non-boundary segments ($y_t=0$), predictions should be smooth:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of non-boundary frames.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Feature Clustering}: All predictions within a ground-truth event segment should cluster in embedding space:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster} = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\frac{1}{|I_s|} \\sum_{i \\in I_s} \\|\\mathbf{z}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $S$ is the number of events in a clip, $I_s$ is the set of frame indices in event $s$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s$ is the mean of $\\mathbf{z}_i$ for $i \\in I_s$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe total SCL is: $\\mathcal{L}_{SCL} = \\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\lambda_s \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} + \\lambda_c \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$.\n\n\\subsection{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)}\nThe AMTD replaces the heuristic online boundary detector (OBD) with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) that learns to detect boundaries from the sequence of SMPE vectors $\\{\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t\\}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture}\nThe AMTD, denoted $\\mathcal{D}_\\phi$, comprises:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-scale Feature Extraction}: Parallel 1D convolutions with kernel sizes $k_1, k_2, k_3$ capture short-, medium-, and long-range temporal patterns in $\\mathbf{E}_t$:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{s}^{(i)}_t = \\text{ReLU}(\\text{Conv1D}_{k_i}([\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t]))\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Dynamic Fusion}: Multi-scale features are concatenated and weighted adaptively via self-attention:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{S}_t = [\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(2)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(3)}_t], \\quad \\mathbf{A}_t = \\text{SelfAttention}(\\mathbf{S}_t)\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Boundary Probability Estimation}: The attended feature produces the final online boundary probability:\n    \\[\n    P_t^{boundary} = \\sigma(\\text{MLP}(\\text{Pool}(\\mathbf{A}_t)))\n    \\]\n    A boundary is declared if $P_t^{boundary} > 0.5$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsubsection{Online Operation and Training}\nDuring online inference, AMTD slides over the streaming SMPE vectors using a FIFO buffer of size $\\Delta+1$. It is trained jointly with the HMT-CEA via SCL, where binary labels $y_t$ supervise $P_t^{boundary}$ through a standard cross-entropy loss, forming a fully differentiable, end-to-end optimizable system for online granular event boundary detection (On-GEBD).\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\subsubsection{Benchmark Datasets.}\nWe evaluate our method on two established benchmarks for generic event boundary detection (GEBD). The \\textbf{Kinetics-GEBD} dataset is derived from the Kinetics-400 dataset, comprising approximately 60K videos. Each video is annotated with taxonomy-free event boundaries, containing about five events on average. The dataset is officially split into training (18,794 videos), validation (18,813 videos), and test (17,725 videos) sets. As test set annotations are withheld, we report results on the validation set, consistent with prior work. For cross-validation in certain analyses, we further split the training data into 80\\% for training and 20\\% for validation. The \\textbf{TAPOS} dataset consists of Olympic sports videos originally annotated for action localization. Following the standard adaptation for GEBD, we repurpose it by discarding action labels and treating sub-action boundaries as generic event boundaries. This results in 13,094 training and 1,790 validation action instances.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evaluation Metric.}\nWe adopt the standard Relative Distance (Rel.Dis) metric for GEBD. For a predicted boundary timestamp and its corresponding ground truth, the relative distance is computed as their temporal offset divided by the duration of the union of the predicted and ground-truth event instances. Following common practice, when multiple consecutive frames are predicted as boundaries, the central frame is taken as the final timestamp. Performance is evaluated under ten Rel.Dis thresholds from 0.05 to 0.5 with a step size of 0.05. A prediction is considered correct if its Rel.Dis is below a given threshold. We report the F1 score at each threshold and the average F1 score across all thresholds.\n\n\\subsubsection{Baselines.}\nEstablishing baselines for Online GEBD (On-GEBD) is non-trivial as standard offline GEBD methods are not designed for streaming input. Therefore, we adapt state-of-the-art models from related online video understanding tasks. From Online Action Detection, we adapt TeSTra, OadTR, and MiniROAD. From Online Temporal Action Localization, we adapt Sim-On. For a fair comparison, we modify only the final layer of each model to perform binary classification (boundary vs. non-boundary), denoted with the suffix '-BC'. We also compare against a dedicated online GEBD method, \\textbf{ESTimator}. Furthermore, to contextualize our online performance, we include comparisons with leading offline GEBD methods.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implementation Details.}\nOur proposed method, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, is implemented using standard video features for fair comparison. Videos are sampled at 24 FPS for Kinetics-GEBD and 6 FPS for TAPOS. We use 2048-dimensional features extracted by an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 encoder. The Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) employs a main memory with dimension $d_m=512$ and a local context cache of size $L=16$. The Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) uses temporal convolutional kernels of sizes $[3, 7, 15]$. The model is trained end-to-end for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $1\\times10^{-4}$, a batch size of 512, and loss weights $\\lambda_s=0.1$ and $\\lambda_c=0.05$.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison with Online Baselines}\nTable~\\ref{tab:online_k400} and Table~\\ref{tab:online_tapos} present the online detection performance on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS validation sets, respectively.\n\nOn Kinetics-GEBD (Table~\\ref{tab:online_k400}), \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming all online baselines across all Rel.Dis thresholds. Traditional online models like TeSTra-BC and Sim-On-BC show limited effectiveness for this task. While MiniROAD-BC and the prior dedicated method ESTimator perform better, our method achieves a superior average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}. This represents an improvement of +3.0\\% over ESTimator and +9.7\\% over MiniROAD-BC, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed architectural components.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Quantitative comparison with online baselines on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set.

We profile the average inference time per frame on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:efficiency}, \\textbf{ESTimator++} processes frames at \\textbf{8.2 ms (∼122 FPS)}, which is significantly faster than the real-time requirement of 24 FPS for the Kinetics dataset. Although it is understandably slower than the simpler ESTimator and some lightweight baselines like TeSTra-BC, its runtime is still an order of magnitude lower than the total latency of offline methods, which must process entire clips. This demonstrates that \\textbf{ESTimator++} successfully balances state-of-the-art accuracy with practical online inference speed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of inference efficiency (lower time per frame is better).

This can be attributed to the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) providing a cleaner signal and the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) learning to distinguish true boundary patterns from noise. Furthermore, in sequences with gradual transitions, \\textbf{ESTimator++} shows improved temporal localization, likely due to the multi-scale receptive field of the AMTD. These observations align with its superior quantitative performance.\n\n\\section{Ablation Studies}\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set to validate the contribution of each component in \\textbf{ESTimator++}. All experiments follow the implementation details in Section~\\ref{sec:setup}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Impact of Proposed Components}\nWe start from a baseline model that uses a standard Transformer decoder for prediction and a single reconstruction error with a fixed heuristic threshold for detection. This baseline achieves an average F1 score of 0.715. We then sequentially integrate our proposed components, with results summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_components}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation study on the contribution of each proposed component. Evaluated on Kinetics-GEBD validation set (Average F1). $\\Delta$ denotes the improvement over the previous row.}\n\\label{tab:ablation_components}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Variant} & \\textbf{HMT} & \\textbf{SMPE} & \\textbf{SCL} & \\textbf{AMTD} & \\textbf{Avg F1} & $\\Delta$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nBaseline (ESTimator Core) & & & & & 0.715 & -- \\\\\n+ Hierarchical Memory (HMT) & \\checkmark & & & & 0.733 & +0.018 \\\\\n+ Structured Error (SMPE) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & & 0.754 & +0.021 \\\\\n+ Consistency Loss (SCL) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & 0.769 & +0.015 \\\\\n+ Adaptive Discriminator (AMTD) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\textbf{0.778} & \\textbf{+0.029} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nIntegrating the \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} improves performance by +1.8\\%, demonstrating the importance of maintaining stable event context for consistent prediction. Replacing the single error with the \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} yields a further gain of +2.1\\%, confirming that a composite error signal provides richer boundary cues. Employing the \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)} for training adds another +1.5\\%, validating that enforcing intra-event smoothness and feature clustering shapes more discriminative representations. Finally, substituting the heuristic threshold with the learned \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} provides the most substantial single-module improvement of +2.9\\%, underscoring the advantage of a data-driven decision function. The full model integrating all components achieves the best performance of \\textbf{0.778}, confirming their synergistic effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{Analysis of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nWe analyze the contribution of each error view within the SMPE by ablating them individually from the full model. Results are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_smpe}. Removing the \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error} causes the most significant drop (-1.7\\% in Avg F1), highlighting its sensitivity to event transitions. Omitting the \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error} leads to a -1.2\\% decrease, demonstrating the importance of tracking high-level event schema changes. Removing the primary \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error} also degrades performance (-1.0\\%). Using any single error view consistently underperforms compared to the full SMPE vector, validating our composite design.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE).

Results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_amtd}. Replacing the AMTD with the original heuristic Online Boundary Detector (OBD) causes a performance drop to 0.748. Using a \\textbf{single-scale} Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) instead of the multi-scale architecture reduces Avg F1 to 0.771. Removing the \\textbf{self-attention based dynamic fusion} and simply concatenating multi-scale features results in a score of 0.774. These ablations confirm that each aspect of the AMTD's design—its learned nature, multi-scale perception, and adaptive fusion—contributes to its effectiveness.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the design of the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD).

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_loss}, training with only the \\textbf{Focal Reconstruction Loss} yields a baseline score of 0.754. Adding the \\textbf{Intra-event Smoothness Loss} improves performance to 0.766. Further incorporating the \\textbf{Intra-event Clustering Loss} to form the full SCL pushes the score to 0.769. The full SCL, combining both regularizers, delivers the best result, confirming that jointly optimizing for local accuracy and global temporal coherence is an effective strategy.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL). The HMT and SMPE are used in all variants.

The hierarchical memory (HMT) establishes a robust predictive foundation, the structured error (SMPE) extracts optimal boundary cues, the consistency loss (SCL) shapes the learning objective, and the adaptive discriminator (AMTD) makes precise online decisions. The full model's superior performance arises from their seamless integration.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\subsection{Training Dynamics and Convergence Analysis}\nTo gain deeper insights into the optimization behavior of \\textbf{ESTimator++}, we analyze its training dynamics. The training and validation loss curves over 30 epochs on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset show that \\textbf{ESTimator++} converges more smoothly and stably to a lower final loss compared to its predecessor \\textbf{ESTimator} and the strong baseline \\textbf{MiniROAD-BC}. This indicates that the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL) provides a more stable gradient signal. Furthermore, the gap between training and validation loss for \\textbf{ESTimator++} remains consistently narrow, suggesting strong generalization and reduced overfitting, a benefit likely attributable to the regularizing effects of $\\mathcal{L}_{Smooth}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$. In contrast, the baseline models exhibit more pronounced fluctuations and a larger generalization gap.\n\n\\subsection{In-depth Case Study}\nWe conduct a systematic case study to examine \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s performance across diverse scenarios. We categorize sequences from the Kinetics-GEBD validation set into groups such as \\textit{‘fast-paced action transitions’}, \\textit{‘gradual scene changes’}, and \\textit{‘static periods with subtle motions’}. For each category, we compare the SMPE signal and final boundary predictions from \\textbf{ESTimator++} against those from \\textbf{ESTimator} and \\textbf{TeSTra-BC}. In fast-paced sequences, \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s AMTD demonstrates superior ability to isolate closely spaced peaks, leading to precise detection of sequential boundaries. For gradual transitions, the multi-view SMPE provides a rising error signal over several frames, which the multi-scale AMTD effectively integrates to produce a confident prediction. During static periods, \\textbf{ESTimator++} exhibits significantly lower spurious activation due to the intra-event smoothness constraint. These observations concretely explain the quantitative improvements shown in the main results.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis paper addresses the task of Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD). We propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced framework that provides a deeper computational implementation of the Event Segmentation Theory (EST). It integrates three key innovations: a Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) for robust event anticipation, a Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) for richer boundary cues, and an Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) for learning boundary decisions. These components are trained end-to-end using a novel Structural Consistency Loss (SCL).\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the Kinetics-GEBD dataset, \\textbf{ESTimator++} achieves a state-of-the-art average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}, significantly outperforming all existing online baselines, including its predecessor ESTimator (0.748). Similarly, on the TAPOS dataset, it attains a leading average F1 score of \\textbf{0.569}. Notably, our online method performs competitively against many powerful offline models, securing the third-highest overall ranking on both benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, with AMTD yielding the most substantial gain as a single module. Furthermore, \\textbf{ESTimator++} maintains a practical inference time of 8.2ms per frame, making it suitable for real-time processing.\n\nIn summary, \\textbf{ESTimator++} establishes a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD by effectively translating cognitive principles into a synergistic neural architecture. It delivers highly accurate boundary detection with low latency, paving the way for more sophisticated real-time video understanding systems. Future work could explore extending this framework to more complex, long-form video streams and multi-modal inputs.\n\n\\end{document}\n\nPlease generate a professional image generation prompt according to the figure type."

While Event Segmentation Theory (EST) provides a cognitive foundation, its computational implementation in prior online methods such as ESTimator is limited. This paper presents \\textbf{ESTimator++}, a significantly enhanced framework that advances the original through a more systematic instantiation of EST.

While tasks such as action recognition are well-established, they predominantly focus on short, trimmed clips with predefined labels. In contrast, the analysis of untrimmed, long-form videos containing complex narratives remains a formidable challenge. Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) tackles this issue by aiming to segment videos into taxonomy-free, semantically coherent units, thereby emulating the human ability to parse continuous visual streams.\n\nCurrent GEBD frameworks operate in an \\textit{offline} manner. They process an entire video segment in one pass, leveraging both past and future context to identify all boundaries simultaneously. This paradigm stands in stark contrast to human perception, which segments events \\textit{online}—sequentially and causally, relying solely on past and present information without any access to future content. To bridge this fundamental gap and more faithfully replicate human cognitive processes, we introduce a novel and more demanding task: \\textbf{Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD)}. In this setting, a model must process a video stream and make immediate, frame-by-frame decisions regarding boundary occurrences, using only historical and current data.\n\nOn-GEBD inherits the inherent challenges of offline GEBD, such as detecting subtle and taxonomy-free transitions, but introduces additional complexities due to its strictly causal and information-limited nature. Existing offline GEBD methods, which often depend on global temporal context through mechanisms like similarity matrices or multi-frame comparisons, are fundamentally incompatible with the online setting. Likewise, naïvely adapting models designed for other online action understanding tasks proves ineffective, as they are not tailored for the fine-grained detection of generic boundaries.\n\nTo address these unique challenges, we propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced online framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) from cognitive science. EST suggests that humans continuously predict upcoming visual input based on an ongoing event model and perceive a boundary when a significant prediction error arises. Our framework operationalizes this principle through three core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer} that maintains a stable representation of the current event for robust future anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error} mechanism that derives a richer and more stable discrepancy signal; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator}, a lightweight network that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-aware decision function. These components are integrated under a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss} that jointly enforces prediction accuracy and temporal coherence.\n\nExtensive experiments on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD. It significantly surpasses all adapted online baselines and, remarkably, achieves performance competitive with many sophisticated offline methods, despite operating under a strict causal constraint. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each proposed component. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we review related work, detail our methodology, present comprehensive experimental results, and provide concluding remarks.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\subsection{Generic Event Boundary Detection}\nGeneric Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify boundaries that align with human perceptual segmentation within untrimmed videos, operating without a predefined taxonomy of events. This task differs from traditional video understanding tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and Action Recognition, as GEBD handles continuous, open-ended semantics. Recent advancements in offline GEBD typically process entire videos or extensive temporal contexts. Representative methods include UBoCo, which leverages temporal similarity matrices with contrastive learning; DDM-Net, which applies progressive attention on multi-level dense difference maps; and CoSeg, which introduces a reconstruction-based objective inspired by cognitive modeling. While these offline methods have shown progress, they are not designed for streaming video. Our work adapts GEBD to the \\textit{online} setting, requiring instantaneous decisions without access to future frames.\n\n\\subsection{Video Understanding}\nVideo understanding encompasses tasks such as Temporal Action Detection (TAD), Temporal Action Localization (TAL), and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). State-of-the-art approaches often employ transformer architectures, memory mechanisms, and end-to-end frameworks. A common limitation is their reliance on a closed set of predefined action classes, which restricts applicability in open-world scenarios. Although open-set formulations for TAL exist, they focus on localizing and classifying known actions. In contrast, GEBD detects boundaries for taxonomy-free events, providing a more general approach to video structure understanding.\n\n\\subsection{Online Video Understanding}\nOnline video understanding methods process data in a streaming fashion, sharing core challenges with Online GEBD (On-GEBD). Relevant tasks include Online Action Detection (OAD), Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), and Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS). For OAD, recent works such as LSTR, TeSTra, and MiniROAD demonstrate the efficacy of transformers and recurrent units. For On-TAL, methods like CAG-QIL and OAT have been proposed. While ODAS shares an online nature with On-GEBD, it is designed for a fixed set of action categories. Conversely, On-GEBD must detect subtle, categorical changes between taxonomy-free events, necessitating a distinct methodological approach from conventional online action-centric models.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur enhanced framework, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, extends the original ESTimator by providing a more systematic computational implementation of Event Segmentation Theory (EST). While retaining the core principle of using prediction discrepancy for online boundary detection, ESTimator++ introduces three key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation, (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer and more stable boundary cues, and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-sensitive decision function. These components are unified during training via a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which enforces both local prediction accuracy and global temporal coherence.\n\n\\subsection{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer for Consistent Event Anticipation (HMT-CEA)}\nThe original Consistent Event Anticipation (CEA) employs a standard transformer decoder with a limited look-back window, which may fail to maintain a persistent representation of an ongoing event's gist. Inspired by human cognition—which uses working memory for immediate context and long-term memory for schemas—we propose the HMT-CEA. It maintains two complementary memory structures: a dynamic \\textbf{Main Event Memory ($\\mathbf{M}$)} that captures the abstract, persistent essence of the current event, and a \\textbf{Local Context Cache ($\\mathbf{C}$)} that holds fine-grained recent features.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture and State Update}\nGiven a stream of frame features $\\mathbf{f}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, we first project them into a memory-compatible space: $\\mathbf{h}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{f}_t)$. The HMT-CEA operates recurrently, maintaining states $(\\mathbf{M}_t, \\mathbf{C}_t)$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Local Context Update}: The cache $\\mathbf{C}_t$ is a FIFO queue of the last $L$ projected features: $\\mathbf{C}_t = [\\mathbf{h}_{t-L}, ..., \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}]$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Main Memory Gated Update}: The core memory $\\mathbf{M}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ is updated via a gated mechanism using the new observation $\\mathbf{h}_t$ and previous context.\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g [\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}; \\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t; \\mathbf{h}_t] + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t = \\text{TransformerBlock}(\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_t, \\mathbf{h}_t)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{M}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t + (1 - \\mathbf{g}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\n    \\]\n    where $\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t$ is the mean-pooled cache, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\\text{TransformerBlock}$ is a lightweight cross-attention module that allows the memory to attend to the local context and new input.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Next-Frame Prediction}: The anticipated feature for frame $t$ is generated by fusing information from both memory levels:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{z}_t = \\text{Decoder}( \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_{t-1} )\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{z}_t)\n    \\]\n    Here, $\\text{Decoder}$ is a small autoregressive transformer that uses $\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}$ as a persistent query and $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ as keys and values, ensuring causality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis architecture ensures predictions are grounded in both the immediate past ($\\mathbf{C}$) and a stable, evolving representation of the current event ($\\mathbf{M}$).\n\n\\subsection{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nInstead of a single scalar error, we define a multi-dimensional error vector $\\mathbf{E}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that captures different facets of prediction inconsistency, yielding a more robust boundary detection signal.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error ($E^{(r)}_t$)}: The primary discrepancy, analogous to the original $\\epsilon_t$, but computed in the projected space for stability.\n    \\[\n    E^{(r)}_t = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{h}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_t}{\\|\\mathbf{h}_t\\| \\|\\mathbf{z}_t\\|}\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error ($E^{(s)}_t$)}: Measures inconsistency between consecutive predictions. Within a consistent event, predictions should vary smoothly.\n    \\[\n    E^{(s)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|_2 - \\beta \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{h}_t - \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\\|_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\beta$ is a scaling factor. This term becomes large only when predictions are jagged despite smooth actual changes.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error ($E^{(m)}_t$)}: Quantifies the impact of the new frame on the main event memory, reflecting a potential high-level schema violation.\n    \\[\n    E^{(m)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{M}_t - \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\\|_1\n    \\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe final SMPE vector is the concatenation: $\\mathbf{E}_t = [E^{(r)}_t, E^{(s)}_t, E^{(m)}_t]^\\top$. This structured error is more informative and less noisy than a scalar counterpart.\n\n\\subsection{Training with Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}\nThe HMT-CEA is trained by minimizing a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which jointly optimizes prediction accuracy and the temporal structural properties implied by EST.\n\n\\subsubsection{Boundary-Aware Focal Reconstruction Loss}\nWe adapt binary cross-entropy to address class imbalance and hard examples using the primary error $E^{(r)}_t$:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{Focal}(E^{(r)}_t, y_t) = - \\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma y_t \\log(p_t) - (1 - \\alpha) p_t^\\gamma (1 - y_t) \\log(1 - p_t)\n\\]\nwhere $p_t = \\text{sigmoid}(-\\lambda \\cdot E^{(r)}_t + b)$, $\\lambda$ and $b$ are learnable parameters, $y_t$ is the boundary label, $\\alpha$ balances class frequency, and $\\gamma$ focuses on hard examples.\n\n\\subsubsection{Temporal Coherence Regularization}\nThis unsupervised loss enforces two structural properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Prediction Smoothness}: Within non-boundary segments ($y_t=0$), predictions should be smooth:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of non-boundary frames.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Feature Clustering}: All predictions within a ground-truth event segment should cluster in embedding space:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster} = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\frac{1}{|I_s|} \\sum_{i \\in I_s} \\|\\mathbf{z}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $S$ is the number of events in a clip, $I_s$ is the set of frame indices in event $s$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s$ is the mean of $\\mathbf{z}_i$ for $i \\in I_s$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe total SCL is: $\\mathcal{L}_{SCL} = \\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\lambda_s \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} + \\lambda_c \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$.\n\n\\subsection{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)}\nThe AMTD replaces the heuristic online boundary detector (OBD) with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) that learns to detect boundaries from the sequence of SMPE vectors $\\{\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t\\}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture}\nThe AMTD, denoted $\\mathcal{D}_\\phi$, comprises:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-scale Feature Extraction}: Parallel 1D convolutions with kernel sizes $k_1, k_2, k_3$ capture short-, medium-, and long-range temporal patterns in $\\mathbf{E}_t$:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{s}^{(i)}_t = \\text{ReLU}(\\text{Conv1D}_{k_i}([\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t]))\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Dynamic Fusion}: Multi-scale features are concatenated and weighted adaptively via self-attention:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{S}_t = [\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(2)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(3)}_t], \\quad \\mathbf{A}_t = \\text{SelfAttention}(\\mathbf{S}_t)\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Boundary Probability Estimation}: The attended feature produces the final online boundary probability:\n    \\[\n    P_t^{boundary} = \\sigma(\\text{MLP}(\\text{Pool}(\\mathbf{A}_t)))\n    \\]\n    A boundary is declared if $P_t^{boundary} > 0.5$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsubsection{Online Operation and Training}\nDuring online inference, AMTD slides over the streaming SMPE vectors using a FIFO buffer of size $\\Delta+1$. It is trained jointly with the HMT-CEA via SCL, where binary labels $y_t$ supervise $P_t^{boundary}$ through a standard cross-entropy loss, forming a fully differentiable, end-to-end optimizable system for online granular event boundary detection (On-GEBD).\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\subsubsection{Benchmark Datasets.}\nWe evaluate our method on two established benchmarks for generic event boundary detection (GEBD). The \\textbf{Kinetics-GEBD} dataset is derived from the Kinetics-400 dataset, comprising approximately 60K videos. Each video is annotated with taxonomy-free event boundaries, containing about five events on average. The dataset is officially split into training (18,794 videos), validation (18,813 videos), and test (17,725 videos) sets. As test set annotations are withheld, we report results on the validation set, consistent with prior work. For cross-validation in certain analyses, we further split the training data into 80\\% for training and 20\\% for validation. The \\textbf{TAPOS} dataset consists of Olympic sports videos originally annotated for action localization. Following the standard adaptation for GEBD, we repurpose it by discarding action labels and treating sub-action boundaries as generic event boundaries. This results in 13,094 training and 1,790 validation action instances.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evaluation Metric.}\nWe adopt the standard Relative Distance (Rel.Dis) metric for GEBD. For a predicted boundary timestamp and its corresponding ground truth, the relative distance is computed as their temporal offset divided by the duration of the union of the predicted and ground-truth event instances. Following common practice, when multiple consecutive frames are predicted as boundaries, the central frame is taken as the final timestamp. Performance is evaluated under ten Rel.Dis thresholds from 0.05 to 0.5 with a step size of 0.05. A prediction is considered correct if its Rel.Dis is below a given threshold. We report the F1 score at each threshold and the average F1 score across all thresholds.\n\n\\subsubsection{Baselines.}\nEstablishing baselines for Online GEBD (On-GEBD) is non-trivial as standard offline GEBD methods are not designed for streaming input. Therefore, we adapt state-of-the-art models from related online video understanding tasks. From Online Action Detection, we adapt TeSTra, OadTR, and MiniROAD. From Online Temporal Action Localization, we adapt Sim-On. For a fair comparison, we modify only the final layer of each model to perform binary classification (boundary vs. non-boundary), denoted with the suffix '-BC'. We also compare against a dedicated online GEBD method, \\textbf{ESTimator}. Furthermore, to contextualize our online performance, we include comparisons with leading offline GEBD methods.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implementation Details.}\nOur proposed method, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, is implemented using standard video features for fair comparison. Videos are sampled at 24 FPS for Kinetics-GEBD and 6 FPS for TAPOS. We use 2048-dimensional features extracted by an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 encoder. The Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) employs a main memory with dimension $d_m=512$ and a local context cache of size $L=16$. The Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) uses temporal convolutional kernels of sizes $[3, 7, 15]$. The model is trained end-to-end for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $1\\times10^{-4}$, a batch size of 512, and loss weights $\\lambda_s=0.1$ and $\\lambda_c=0.05$.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison with Online Baselines}\nTable~\\ref{tab:online_k400} and Table~\\ref{tab:online_tapos} present the online detection performance on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS validation sets, respectively.\n\nOn Kinetics-GEBD (Table~\\ref{tab:online_k400}), \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming all online baselines across all Rel.Dis thresholds. Traditional online models like TeSTra-BC and Sim-On-BC show limited effectiveness for this task. While MiniROAD-BC and the prior dedicated method ESTimator perform better, our method achieves a superior average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}. This represents an improvement of +3.0\\% over ESTimator and +9.7\\% over MiniROAD-BC, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed architectural components.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Quantitative comparison with online baselines on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set.

We profile the average inference time per frame on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:efficiency}, \\textbf{ESTimator++} processes frames at \\textbf{8.2 ms (∼122 FPS)}, which is significantly faster than the real-time requirement of 24 FPS for the Kinetics dataset. Although it is understandably slower than the simpler ESTimator and some lightweight baselines like TeSTra-BC, its runtime is still an order of magnitude lower than the total latency of offline methods, which must process entire clips. This demonstrates that \\textbf{ESTimator++} successfully balances state-of-the-art accuracy with practical online inference speed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of inference efficiency (lower time per frame is better).

This can be attributed to the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) providing a cleaner signal and the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) learning to distinguish true boundary patterns from noise. Furthermore, in sequences with gradual transitions, \\textbf{ESTimator++} shows improved temporal localization, likely due to the multi-scale receptive field of the AMTD. These observations align with its superior quantitative performance.\n\n\\section{Ablation Studies}\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set to validate the contribution of each component in \\textbf{ESTimator++}. All experiments follow the implementation details in Section~\\ref{sec:setup}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Impact of Proposed Components}\nWe start from a baseline model that uses a standard Transformer decoder for prediction and a single reconstruction error with a fixed heuristic threshold for detection. This baseline achieves an average F1 score of 0.715. We then sequentially integrate our proposed components, with results summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_components}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation study on the contribution of each proposed component. Evaluated on Kinetics-GEBD validation set (Average F1). $\\Delta$ denotes the improvement over the previous row.}\n\\label{tab:ablation_components}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Variant} & \\textbf{HMT} & \\textbf{SMPE} & \\textbf{SCL} & \\textbf{AMTD} & \\textbf{Avg F1} & $\\Delta$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nBaseline (ESTimator Core) & & & & & 0.715 & -- \\\\\n+ Hierarchical Memory (HMT) & \\checkmark & & & & 0.733 & +0.018 \\\\\n+ Structured Error (SMPE) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & & 0.754 & +0.021 \\\\\n+ Consistency Loss (SCL) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & 0.769 & +0.015 \\\\\n+ Adaptive Discriminator (AMTD) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\textbf{0.778} & \\textbf{+0.029} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nIntegrating the \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} improves performance by +1.8\\%, demonstrating the importance of maintaining stable event context for consistent prediction. Replacing the single error with the \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} yields a further gain of +2.1\\%, confirming that a composite error signal provides richer boundary cues. Employing the \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)} for training adds another +1.5\\%, validating that enforcing intra-event smoothness and feature clustering shapes more discriminative representations. Finally, substituting the heuristic threshold with the learned \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} provides the most substantial single-module improvement of +2.9\\%, underscoring the advantage of a data-driven decision function. The full model integrating all components achieves the best performance of \\textbf{0.778}, confirming their synergistic effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{Analysis of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nWe analyze the contribution of each error view within the SMPE by ablating them individually from the full model. Results are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_smpe}. Removing the \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error} causes the most significant drop (-1.7\\% in Avg F1), highlighting its sensitivity to event transitions. Omitting the \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error} leads to a -1.2\\% decrease, demonstrating the importance of tracking high-level event schema changes. Removing the primary \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error} also degrades performance (-1.0\\%). Using any single error view consistently underperforms compared to the full SMPE vector, validating our composite design.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE).

Results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_amtd}. Replacing the AMTD with the original heuristic Online Boundary Detector (OBD) causes a performance drop to 0.748. Using a \\textbf{single-scale} Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) instead of the multi-scale architecture reduces Avg F1 to 0.771. Removing the \\textbf{self-attention based dynamic fusion} and simply concatenating multi-scale features results in a score of 0.774. These ablations confirm that each aspect of the AMTD's design—its learned nature, multi-scale perception, and adaptive fusion—contributes to its effectiveness.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the design of the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD).

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_loss}, training with only the \\textbf{Focal Reconstruction Loss} yields a baseline score of 0.754. Adding the \\textbf{Intra-event Smoothness Loss} improves performance to 0.766. Further incorporating the \\textbf{Intra-event Clustering Loss} to form the full SCL pushes the score to 0.769. The full SCL, combining both regularizers, delivers the best result, confirming that jointly optimizing for local accuracy and global temporal coherence is an effective strategy.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL). The HMT and SMPE are used in all variants.

The hierarchical memory (HMT) establishes a robust predictive foundation, the structured error (SMPE) extracts optimal boundary cues, the consistency loss (SCL) shapes the learning objective, and the adaptive discriminator (AMTD) makes precise online decisions. The full model's superior performance arises from their seamless integration.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\subsection{Training Dynamics and Convergence Analysis}\nTo gain deeper insights into the optimization behavior of \\textbf{ESTimator++}, we analyze its training dynamics. The training and validation loss curves over 30 epochs on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset show that \\textbf{ESTimator++} converges more smoothly and stably to a lower final loss compared to its predecessor \\textbf{ESTimator} and the strong baseline \\textbf{MiniROAD-BC}. This indicates that the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL) provides a more stable gradient signal. Furthermore, the gap between training and validation loss for \\textbf{ESTimator++} remains consistently narrow, suggesting strong generalization and reduced overfitting, a benefit likely attributable to the regularizing effects of $\\mathcal{L}_{Smooth}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$. In contrast, the baseline models exhibit more pronounced fluctuations and a larger generalization gap.\n\n\\subsection{In-depth Case Study}\nWe conduct a systematic case study to examine \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s performance across diverse scenarios. We categorize sequences from the Kinetics-GEBD validation set into groups such as \\textit{‘fast-paced action transitions’}, \\textit{‘gradual scene changes’}, and \\textit{‘static periods with subtle motions’}. For each category, we compare the SMPE signal and final boundary predictions from \\textbf{ESTimator++} against those from \\textbf{ESTimator} and \\textbf{TeSTra-BC}. In fast-paced sequences, \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s AMTD demonstrates superior ability to isolate closely spaced peaks, leading to precise detection of sequential boundaries. For gradual transitions, the multi-view SMPE provides a rising error signal over several frames, which the multi-scale AMTD effectively integrates to produce a confident prediction. During static periods, \\textbf{ESTimator++} exhibits significantly lower spurious activation due to the intra-event smoothness constraint. These observations concretely explain the quantitative improvements shown in the main results.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis paper addresses the task of Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD). We propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced framework that provides a deeper computational implementation of the Event Segmentation Theory (EST). It integrates three key innovations: a Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) for robust event anticipation, a Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) for richer boundary cues, and an Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) for learning boundary decisions. These components are trained end-to-end using a novel Structural Consistency Loss (SCL).\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the Kinetics-GEBD dataset, \\textbf{ESTimator++} achieves a state-of-the-art average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}, significantly outperforming all existing online baselines, including its predecessor ESTimator (0.748). Similarly, on the TAPOS dataset, it attains a leading average F1 score of \\textbf{0.569}. Notably, our online method performs competitively against many powerful offline models, securing the third-highest overall ranking on both benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, with AMTD yielding the most substantial gain as a single module. Furthermore, \\textbf{ESTimator++} maintains a practical inference time of 8.2ms per frame, making it suitable for real-time processing.\n\nIn summary, \\textbf{ESTimator++} establishes a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD by effectively translating cognitive principles into a synergistic neural architecture. It delivers highly accurate boundary detection with low latency, paving the way for more sophisticated real-time video understanding systems. Future work could explore extending this framework to more complex, long-form video streams and multi-modal inputs.\n\n\\end{document}\n\nPlease generate a professional image generation prompt according to the figure type."

This paper presents \\textbf{ESTimator++}, a significantly enhanced framework that advances the original through a more systematic instantiation of EST. Our key contributions are threefold: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer boundary signals; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} which replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned decision function.

Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, with the AMTD providing the most significant single-module gain (+2.9\\%). Remarkably, this is achieved while maintaining high efficiency at \\textbf{8.2 ms per frame}. Our work demonstrates that a principled, integrated design substantially advances the performance of online event segmentation.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe proliferation of long-form video content on platforms like YouTube and Netflix has created a pressing need for advanced video understanding systems. While tasks such as action recognition are well-established, they predominantly focus on short, trimmed clips with predefined labels. In contrast, the analysis of untrimmed, long-form videos containing complex narratives remains a formidable challenge. Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) tackles this issue by aiming to segment videos into taxonomy-free, semantically coherent units, thereby emulating the human ability to parse continuous visual streams.\n\nCurrent GEBD frameworks operate in an \\textit{offline} manner. They process an entire video segment in one pass, leveraging both past and future context to identify all boundaries simultaneously. This paradigm stands in stark contrast to human perception, which segments events \\textit{online}—sequentially and causally, relying solely on past and present information without any access to future content. To bridge this fundamental gap and more faithfully replicate human cognitive processes, we introduce a novel and more demanding task: \\textbf{Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD)}. In this setting, a model must process a video stream and make immediate, frame-by-frame decisions regarding boundary occurrences, using only historical and current data.\n\nOn-GEBD inherits the inherent challenges of offline GEBD, such as detecting subtle and taxonomy-free transitions, but introduces additional complexities due to its strictly causal and information-limited nature. Existing offline GEBD methods, which often depend on global temporal context through mechanisms like similarity matrices or multi-frame comparisons, are fundamentally incompatible with the online setting. Likewise, naïvely adapting models designed for other online action understanding tasks proves ineffective, as they are not tailored for the fine-grained detection of generic boundaries.\n\nTo address these unique challenges, we propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced online framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) from cognitive science. EST suggests that humans continuously predict upcoming visual input based on an ongoing event model and perceive a boundary when a significant prediction error arises. Our framework operationalizes this principle through three core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer} that maintains a stable representation of the current event for robust future anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error} mechanism that derives a richer and more stable discrepancy signal; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator}, a lightweight network that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-aware decision function. These components are integrated under a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss} that jointly enforces prediction accuracy and temporal coherence.\n\nExtensive experiments on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD. It significantly surpasses all adapted online baselines and, remarkably, achieves performance competitive with many sophisticated offline methods, despite operating under a strict causal constraint. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each proposed component. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we review related work, detail our methodology, present comprehensive experimental results, and provide concluding remarks.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\subsection{Generic Event Boundary Detection}\nGeneric Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify boundaries that align with human perceptual segmentation within untrimmed videos, operating without a predefined taxonomy of events. This task differs from traditional video understanding tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and Action Recognition, as GEBD handles continuous, open-ended semantics. Recent advancements in offline GEBD typically process entire videos or extensive temporal contexts. Representative methods include UBoCo, which leverages temporal similarity matrices with contrastive learning; DDM-Net, which applies progressive attention on multi-level dense difference maps; and CoSeg, which introduces a reconstruction-based objective inspired by cognitive modeling. While these offline methods have shown progress, they are not designed for streaming video. Our work adapts GEBD to the \\textit{online} setting, requiring instantaneous decisions without access to future frames.\n\n\\subsection{Video Understanding}\nVideo understanding encompasses tasks such as Temporal Action Detection (TAD), Temporal Action Localization (TAL), and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). State-of-the-art approaches often employ transformer architectures, memory mechanisms, and end-to-end frameworks. A common limitation is their reliance on a closed set of predefined action classes, which restricts applicability in open-world scenarios. Although open-set formulations for TAL exist, they focus on localizing and classifying known actions. In contrast, GEBD detects boundaries for taxonomy-free events, providing a more general approach to video structure understanding.\n\n\\subsection{Online Video Understanding}\nOnline video understanding methods process data in a streaming fashion, sharing core challenges with Online GEBD (On-GEBD). Relevant tasks include Online Action Detection (OAD), Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), and Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS). For OAD, recent works such as LSTR, TeSTra, and MiniROAD demonstrate the efficacy of transformers and recurrent units. For On-TAL, methods like CAG-QIL and OAT have been proposed. While ODAS shares an online nature with On-GEBD, it is designed for a fixed set of action categories. Conversely, On-GEBD must detect subtle, categorical changes between taxonomy-free events, necessitating a distinct methodological approach from conventional online action-centric models.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur enhanced framework, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, extends the original ESTimator by providing a more systematic computational implementation of Event Segmentation Theory (EST). While retaining the core principle of using prediction discrepancy for online boundary detection, ESTimator++ introduces three key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation, (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer and more stable boundary cues, and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-sensitive decision function. These components are unified during training via a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which enforces both local prediction accuracy and global temporal coherence.\n\n\\subsection{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer for Consistent Event Anticipation (HMT-CEA)}\nThe original Consistent Event Anticipation (CEA) employs a standard transformer decoder with a limited look-back window, which may fail to maintain a persistent representation of an ongoing event's gist. Inspired by human cognition—which uses working memory for immediate context and long-term memory for schemas—we propose the HMT-CEA. It maintains two complementary memory structures: a dynamic \\textbf{Main Event Memory ($\\mathbf{M}$)} that captures the abstract, persistent essence of the current event, and a \\textbf{Local Context Cache ($\\mathbf{C}$)} that holds fine-grained recent features.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture and State Update}\nGiven a stream of frame features $\\mathbf{f}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, we first project them into a memory-compatible space: $\\mathbf{h}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{f}_t)$. The HMT-CEA operates recurrently, maintaining states $(\\mathbf{M}_t, \\mathbf{C}_t)$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Local Context Update}: The cache $\\mathbf{C}_t$ is a FIFO queue of the last $L$ projected features: $\\mathbf{C}_t = [\\mathbf{h}_{t-L}, ..., \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}]$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Main Memory Gated Update}: The core memory $\\mathbf{M}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ is updated via a gated mechanism using the new observation $\\mathbf{h}_t$ and previous context.\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g [\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}; \\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t; \\mathbf{h}_t] + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t = \\text{TransformerBlock}(\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_t, \\mathbf{h}_t)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{M}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t + (1 - \\mathbf{g}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\n    \\]\n    where $\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t$ is the mean-pooled cache, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\\text{TransformerBlock}$ is a lightweight cross-attention module that allows the memory to attend to the local context and new input.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Next-Frame Prediction}: The anticipated feature for frame $t$ is generated by fusing information from both memory levels:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{z}_t = \\text{Decoder}( \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_{t-1} )\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{z}_t)\n    \\]\n    Here, $\\text{Decoder}$ is a small autoregressive transformer that uses $\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}$ as a persistent query and $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ as keys and values, ensuring causality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis architecture ensures predictions are grounded in both the immediate past ($\\mathbf{C}$) and a stable, evolving representation of the current event ($\\mathbf{M}$).\n\n\\subsection{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nInstead of a single scalar error, we define a multi-dimensional error vector $\\mathbf{E}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that captures different facets of prediction inconsistency, yielding a more robust boundary detection signal.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error ($E^{(r)}_t$)}: The primary discrepancy, analogous to the original $\\epsilon_t$, but computed in the projected space for stability.\n    \\[\n    E^{(r)}_t = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{h}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_t}{\\|\\mathbf{h}_t\\| \\|\\mathbf{z}_t\\|}\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error ($E^{(s)}_t$)}: Measures inconsistency between consecutive predictions. Within a consistent event, predictions should vary smoothly.\n    \\[\n    E^{(s)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|_2 - \\beta \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{h}_t - \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\\|_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\beta$ is a scaling factor. This term becomes large only when predictions are jagged despite smooth actual changes.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error ($E^{(m)}_t$)}: Quantifies the impact of the new frame on the main event memory, reflecting a potential high-level schema violation.\n    \\[\n    E^{(m)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{M}_t - \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\\|_1\n    \\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe final SMPE vector is the concatenation: $\\mathbf{E}_t = [E^{(r)}_t, E^{(s)}_t, E^{(m)}_t]^\\top$. This structured error is more informative and less noisy than a scalar counterpart.\n\n\\subsection{Training with Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}\nThe HMT-CEA is trained by minimizing a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which jointly optimizes prediction accuracy and the temporal structural properties implied by EST.\n\n\\subsubsection{Boundary-Aware Focal Reconstruction Loss}\nWe adapt binary cross-entropy to address class imbalance and hard examples using the primary error $E^{(r)}_t$:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{Focal}(E^{(r)}_t, y_t) = - \\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma y_t \\log(p_t) - (1 - \\alpha) p_t^\\gamma (1 - y_t) \\log(1 - p_t)\n\\]\nwhere $p_t = \\text{sigmoid}(-\\lambda \\cdot E^{(r)}_t + b)$, $\\lambda$ and $b$ are learnable parameters, $y_t$ is the boundary label, $\\alpha$ balances class frequency, and $\\gamma$ focuses on hard examples.\n\n\\subsubsection{Temporal Coherence Regularization}\nThis unsupervised loss enforces two structural properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Prediction Smoothness}: Within non-boundary segments ($y_t=0$), predictions should be smooth:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of non-boundary frames.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Feature Clustering}: All predictions within a ground-truth event segment should cluster in embedding space:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster} = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\frac{1}{|I_s|} \\sum_{i \\in I_s} \\|\\mathbf{z}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $S$ is the number of events in a clip, $I_s$ is the set of frame indices in event $s$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s$ is the mean of $\\mathbf{z}_i$ for $i \\in I_s$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe total SCL is: $\\mathcal{L}_{SCL} = \\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\lambda_s \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} + \\lambda_c \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$.\n\n\\subsection{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)}\nThe AMTD replaces the heuristic online boundary detector (OBD) with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) that learns to detect boundaries from the sequence of SMPE vectors $\\{\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t\\}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture}\nThe AMTD, denoted $\\mathcal{D}_\\phi$, comprises:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-scale Feature Extraction}: Parallel 1D convolutions with kernel sizes $k_1, k_2, k_3$ capture short-, medium-, and long-range temporal patterns in $\\mathbf{E}_t$:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{s}^{(i)}_t = \\text{ReLU}(\\text{Conv1D}_{k_i}([\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t]))\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Dynamic Fusion}: Multi-scale features are concatenated and weighted adaptively via self-attention:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{S}_t = [\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(2)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(3)}_t], \\quad \\mathbf{A}_t = \\text{SelfAttention}(\\mathbf{S}_t)\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Boundary Probability Estimation}: The attended feature produces the final online boundary probability:\n    \\[\n    P_t^{boundary} = \\sigma(\\text{MLP}(\\text{Pool}(\\mathbf{A}_t)))\n    \\]\n    A boundary is declared if $P_t^{boundary} > 0.5$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsubsection{Online Operation and Training}\nDuring online inference, AMTD slides over the streaming SMPE vectors using a FIFO buffer of size $\\Delta+1$. It is trained jointly with the HMT-CEA via SCL, where binary labels $y_t$ supervise $P_t^{boundary}$ through a standard cross-entropy loss, forming a fully differentiable, end-to-end optimizable system for online granular event boundary detection (On-GEBD).\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\subsubsection{Benchmark Datasets.}\nWe evaluate our method on two established benchmarks for generic event boundary detection (GEBD). The \\textbf{Kinetics-GEBD} dataset is derived from the Kinetics-400 dataset, comprising approximately 60K videos. Each video is annotated with taxonomy-free event boundaries, containing about five events on average. The dataset is officially split into training (18,794 videos), validation (18,813 videos), and test (17,725 videos) sets. As test set annotations are withheld, we report results on the validation set, consistent with prior work. For cross-validation in certain analyses, we further split the training data into 80\\% for training and 20\\% for validation. The \\textbf{TAPOS} dataset consists of Olympic sports videos originally annotated for action localization. Following the standard adaptation for GEBD, we repurpose it by discarding action labels and treating sub-action boundaries as generic event boundaries. This results in 13,094 training and 1,790 validation action instances.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evaluation Metric.}\nWe adopt the standard Relative Distance (Rel.Dis) metric for GEBD. For a predicted boundary timestamp and its corresponding ground truth, the relative distance is computed as their temporal offset divided by the duration of the union of the predicted and ground-truth event instances. Following common practice, when multiple consecutive frames are predicted as boundaries, the central frame is taken as the final timestamp. Performance is evaluated under ten Rel.Dis thresholds from 0.05 to 0.5 with a step size of 0.05. A prediction is considered correct if its Rel.Dis is below a given threshold. We report the F1 score at each threshold and the average F1 score across all thresholds.\n\n\\subsubsection{Baselines.}\nEstablishing baselines for Online GEBD (On-GEBD) is non-trivial as standard offline GEBD methods are not designed for streaming input. Therefore, we adapt state-of-the-art models from related online video understanding tasks. From Online Action Detection, we adapt TeSTra, OadTR, and MiniROAD. From Online Temporal Action Localization, we adapt Sim-On. For a fair comparison, we modify only the final layer of each model to perform binary classification (boundary vs. non-boundary), denoted with the suffix '-BC'. We also compare against a dedicated online GEBD method, \\textbf{ESTimator}. Furthermore, to contextualize our online performance, we include comparisons with leading offline GEBD methods.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implementation Details.}\nOur proposed method, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, is implemented using standard video features for fair comparison. Videos are sampled at 24 FPS for Kinetics-GEBD and 6 FPS for TAPOS. We use 2048-dimensional features extracted by an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 encoder. The Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) employs a main memory with dimension $d_m=512$ and a local context cache of size $L=16$. The Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) uses temporal convolutional kernels of sizes $[3, 7, 15]$. The model is trained end-to-end for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $1\\times10^{-4}$, a batch size of 512, and loss weights $\\lambda_s=0.1$ and $\\lambda_c=0.05$.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison with Online Baselines}\nTable~\\ref{tab:online_k400} and Table~\\ref{tab:online_tapos} present the online detection performance on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS validation sets, respectively.\n\nOn Kinetics-GEBD (Table~\\ref{tab:online_k400}), \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming all online baselines across all Rel.Dis thresholds. Traditional online models like TeSTra-BC and Sim-On-BC show limited effectiveness for this task. While MiniROAD-BC and the prior dedicated method ESTimator perform better, our method achieves a superior average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}. This represents an improvement of +3.0\\% over ESTimator and +9.7\\% over MiniROAD-BC, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed architectural components.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Quantitative comparison with online baselines on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set.

We profile the average inference time per frame on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:efficiency}, \\textbf{ESTimator++} processes frames at \\textbf{8.2 ms (∼122 FPS)}, which is significantly faster than the real-time requirement of 24 FPS for the Kinetics dataset. Although it is understandably slower than the simpler ESTimator and some lightweight baselines like TeSTra-BC, its runtime is still an order of magnitude lower than the total latency of offline methods, which must process entire clips. This demonstrates that \\textbf{ESTimator++} successfully balances state-of-the-art accuracy with practical online inference speed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of inference efficiency (lower time per frame is better).

This can be attributed to the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) providing a cleaner signal and the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) learning to distinguish true boundary patterns from noise. Furthermore, in sequences with gradual transitions, \\textbf{ESTimator++} shows improved temporal localization, likely due to the multi-scale receptive field of the AMTD. These observations align with its superior quantitative performance.\n\n\\section{Ablation Studies}\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set to validate the contribution of each component in \\textbf{ESTimator++}. All experiments follow the implementation details in Section~\\ref{sec:setup}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Impact of Proposed Components}\nWe start from a baseline model that uses a standard Transformer decoder for prediction and a single reconstruction error with a fixed heuristic threshold for detection. This baseline achieves an average F1 score of 0.715. We then sequentially integrate our proposed components, with results summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_components}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation study on the contribution of each proposed component. Evaluated on Kinetics-GEBD validation set (Average F1). $\\Delta$ denotes the improvement over the previous row.}\n\\label{tab:ablation_components}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Variant} & \\textbf{HMT} & \\textbf{SMPE} & \\textbf{SCL} & \\textbf{AMTD} & \\textbf{Avg F1} & $\\Delta$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nBaseline (ESTimator Core) & & & & & 0.715 & -- \\\\\n+ Hierarchical Memory (HMT) & \\checkmark & & & & 0.733 & +0.018 \\\\\n+ Structured Error (SMPE) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & & 0.754 & +0.021 \\\\\n+ Consistency Loss (SCL) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & & 0.769 & +0.015 \\\\\n+ Adaptive Discriminator (AMTD) & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\checkmark & \\textbf{0.778} & \\textbf{+0.029} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nIntegrating the \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} improves performance by +1.8\\%, demonstrating the importance of maintaining stable event context for consistent prediction. Replacing the single error with the \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} yields a further gain of +2.1\\%, confirming that a composite error signal provides richer boundary cues. Employing the \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)} for training adds another +1.5\\%, validating that enforcing intra-event smoothness and feature clustering shapes more discriminative representations. Finally, substituting the heuristic threshold with the learned \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} provides the most substantial single-module improvement of +2.9\\%, underscoring the advantage of a data-driven decision function. The full model integrating all components achieves the best performance of \\textbf{0.778}, confirming their synergistic effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{Analysis of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nWe analyze the contribution of each error view within the SMPE by ablating them individually from the full model. Results are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_smpe}. Removing the \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error} causes the most significant drop (-1.7\\% in Avg F1), highlighting its sensitivity to event transitions. Omitting the \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error} leads to a -1.2\\% decrease, demonstrating the importance of tracking high-level event schema changes. Removing the primary \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error} also degrades performance (-1.0\\%). Using any single error view consistently underperforms compared to the full SMPE vector, validating our composite design.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE).

Results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_amtd}. Replacing the AMTD with the original heuristic Online Boundary Detector (OBD) causes a performance drop to 0.748. Using a \\textbf{single-scale} Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) instead of the multi-scale architecture reduces Avg F1 to 0.771. Removing the \\textbf{self-attention based dynamic fusion} and simply concatenating multi-scale features results in a score of 0.774. These ablations confirm that each aspect of the AMTD's design—its learned nature, multi-scale perception, and adaptive fusion—contributes to its effectiveness.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the design of the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD).

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_loss}, training with only the \\textbf{Focal Reconstruction Loss} yields a baseline score of 0.754. Adding the \\textbf{Intra-event Smoothness Loss} improves performance to 0.766. Further incorporating the \\textbf{Intra-event Clustering Loss} to form the full SCL pushes the score to 0.769. The full SCL, combining both regularizers, delivers the best result, confirming that jointly optimizing for local accuracy and global temporal coherence is an effective strategy.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL). The HMT and SMPE are used in all variants. Evaluated on Kinetics-GEBD validation set (Average F1).}\n\\label{tab:ablation_loss}\n\\begin{tabular}{lc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Training Loss Variant} & \\textbf{Avg F1} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\mathcal{L}_{Focal}$ only & 0.754 \\\\\n$\\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth}$ & 0.766 \\\\\n$\\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$ & 0.762 \\\\\n\\textbf{Full SCL} ($\\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} + \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$) & \\textbf{0.769} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\textbf{Summary.} Our ablation studies provide compelling evidence for the necessity and effectiveness of every component in \\textbf{ESTimator++}. The hierarchical memory (HMT) establishes a robust predictive foundation, the structured error (SMPE) extracts optimal boundary cues, the consistency loss (SCL) shapes the learning objective, and the adaptive discriminator (AMTD) makes precise online decisions. The full model's superior performance arises from their seamless integration.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\subsection{Training Dynamics and Convergence Analysis}\nTo gain deeper insights into the optimization behavior of \\textbf{ESTimator++}, we analyze its training dynamics. The training and validation loss curves over 30 epochs on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset show that \\textbf{ESTimator++} converges more smoothly and stably to a lower final loss compared to its predecessor \\textbf{ESTimator} and the strong baseline \\textbf{MiniROAD-BC}. This indicates that the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL) provides a more stable gradient signal. Furthermore, the gap between training and validation loss for \\textbf{ESTimator++} remains consistently narrow, suggesting strong generalization and reduced overfitting, a benefit likely attributable to the regularizing effects of $\\mathcal{L}_{Smooth}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$. In contrast, the baseline models exhibit more pronounced fluctuations and a larger generalization gap.\n\n\\subsection{In-depth Case Study}\nWe conduct a systematic case study to examine \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s performance across diverse scenarios. We categorize sequences from the Kinetics-GEBD validation set into groups such as \\textit{‘fast-paced action transitions’}, \\textit{‘gradual scene changes’}, and \\textit{‘static periods with subtle motions’}. For each category, we compare the SMPE signal and final boundary predictions from \\textbf{ESTimator++} against those from \\textbf{ESTimator} and \\textbf{TeSTra-BC}. In fast-paced sequences, \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s AMTD demonstrates superior ability to isolate closely spaced peaks, leading to precise detection of sequential boundaries. For gradual transitions, the multi-view SMPE provides a rising error signal over several frames, which the multi-scale AMTD effectively integrates to produce a confident prediction. During static periods, \\textbf{ESTimator++} exhibits significantly lower spurious activation due to the intra-event smoothness constraint. These observations concretely explain the quantitative improvements shown in the main results.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis paper addresses the task of Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD). We propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced framework that provides a deeper computational implementation of the Event Segmentation Theory (EST). It integrates three key innovations: a Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) for robust event anticipation, a Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) for richer boundary cues, and an Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) for learning boundary decisions. These components are trained end-to-end using a novel Structural Consistency Loss (SCL).\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the Kinetics-GEBD dataset, \\textbf{ESTimator++} achieves a state-of-the-art average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}, significantly outperforming all existing online baselines, including its predecessor ESTimator (0.748). Similarly, on the TAPOS dataset, it attains a leading average F1 score of \\textbf{0.569}. Notably, our online method performs competitively against many powerful offline models, securing the third-highest overall ranking on both benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, with AMTD yielding the most substantial gain as a single module. Furthermore, \\textbf{ESTimator++} maintains a practical inference time of 8.2ms per frame, making it suitable for real-time processing.\n\nIn summary, \\textbf{ESTimator++} establishes a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD by effectively translating cognitive principles into a synergistic neural architecture. It delivers highly accurate boundary detection with low latency, paving the way for more sophisticated real-time video understanding systems. Future work could explore extending this framework to more complex, long-form video streams and multi-modal inputs.\n\n\\end{document}\n\nPlease generate a professional image generation prompt according to the figure type."

Our key contributions are threefold: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer boundary signals; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} which replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned decision function. These components are integrated via a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, enabling end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks demonstrate that ESTimator++ achieves state-of-the-art performance for On-GEBD, with average F1 scores of \\textbf{0.778} and \\textbf{0.569}, respectively, outperforming all existing online methods and competing favorably with many offline models. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, with the AMTD providing the most significant single-module gain (+2.9\\%). Remarkably, this is achieved while maintaining high efficiency at \\textbf{8.2 ms per frame}. Our work demonstrates that a principled, integrated design substantially advances the performance of online event segmentation.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe proliferation of long-form video content on platforms like YouTube and Netflix has created a pressing need for advanced video understanding systems. While tasks such as action recognition are well-established, they predominantly focus on short, trimmed clips with predefined labels. In contrast, the analysis of untrimmed, long-form videos containing complex narratives remains a formidable challenge. Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) tackles this issue by aiming to segment videos into taxonomy-free, semantically coherent units, thereby emulating the human ability to parse continuous visual streams.\n\nCurrent GEBD frameworks operate in an \\textit{offline} manner. They process an entire video segment in one pass, leveraging both past and future context to identify all boundaries simultaneously. This paradigm stands in stark contrast to human perception, which segments events \\textit{online}—sequentially and causally, relying solely on past and present information without any access to future content. To bridge this fundamental gap and more faithfully replicate human cognitive processes, we introduce a novel and more demanding task: \\textbf{Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD)}. In this setting, a model must process a video stream and make immediate, frame-by-frame decisions regarding boundary occurrences, using only historical and current data.\n\nOn-GEBD inherits the inherent challenges of offline GEBD, such as detecting subtle and taxonomy-free transitions, but introduces additional complexities due to its strictly causal and information-limited nature. Existing offline GEBD methods, which often depend on global temporal context through mechanisms like similarity matrices or multi-frame comparisons, are fundamentally incompatible with the online setting. Likewise, naïvely adapting models designed for other online action understanding tasks proves ineffective, as they are not tailored for the fine-grained detection of generic boundaries.\n\nTo address these unique challenges, we propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced online framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) from cognitive science. EST suggests that humans continuously predict upcoming visual input based on an ongoing event model and perceive a boundary when a significant prediction error arises. Our framework operationalizes this principle through three core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer} that maintains a stable representation of the current event for robust future anticipation; (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error} mechanism that derives a richer and more stable discrepancy signal; and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator}, a lightweight network that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-aware decision function. These components are integrated under a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss} that jointly enforces prediction accuracy and temporal coherence.\n\nExtensive experiments on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD. It significantly surpasses all adapted online baselines and, remarkably, achieves performance competitive with many sophisticated offline methods, despite operating under a strict causal constraint. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each proposed component. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we review related work, detail our methodology, present comprehensive experimental results, and provide concluding remarks.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\subsection{Generic Event Boundary Detection}\nGeneric Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify boundaries that align with human perceptual segmentation within untrimmed videos, operating without a predefined taxonomy of events. This task differs from traditional video understanding tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and Action Recognition, as GEBD handles continuous, open-ended semantics. Recent advancements in offline GEBD typically process entire videos or extensive temporal contexts. Representative methods include UBoCo, which leverages temporal similarity matrices with contrastive learning; DDM-Net, which applies progressive attention on multi-level dense difference maps; and CoSeg, which introduces a reconstruction-based objective inspired by cognitive modeling. While these offline methods have shown progress, they are not designed for streaming video. Our work adapts GEBD to the \\textit{online} setting, requiring instantaneous decisions without access to future frames.\n\n\\subsection{Video Understanding}\nVideo understanding encompasses tasks such as Temporal Action Detection (TAD), Temporal Action Localization (TAL), and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). State-of-the-art approaches often employ transformer architectures, memory mechanisms, and end-to-end frameworks. A common limitation is their reliance on a closed set of predefined action classes, which restricts applicability in open-world scenarios. Although open-set formulations for TAL exist, they focus on localizing and classifying known actions. In contrast, GEBD detects boundaries for taxonomy-free events, providing a more general approach to video structure understanding.\n\n\\subsection{Online Video Understanding}\nOnline video understanding methods process data in a streaming fashion, sharing core challenges with Online GEBD (On-GEBD). Relevant tasks include Online Action Detection (OAD), Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), and Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS). For OAD, recent works such as LSTR, TeSTra, and MiniROAD demonstrate the efficacy of transformers and recurrent units. For On-TAL, methods like CAG-QIL and OAT have been proposed. While ODAS shares an online nature with On-GEBD, it is designed for a fixed set of action categories. Conversely, On-GEBD must detect subtle, categorical changes between taxonomy-free events, necessitating a distinct methodological approach from conventional online action-centric models.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur enhanced framework, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, extends the original ESTimator by providing a more systematic computational implementation of Event Segmentation Theory (EST). While retaining the core principle of using prediction discrepancy for online boundary detection, ESTimator++ introduces three key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT)} for robust, context-aware event anticipation, (2) a \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} that extracts richer and more stable boundary cues, and (3) an \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} that replaces heuristic thresholding with a learned, context-sensitive decision function. These components are unified during training via a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which enforces both local prediction accuracy and global temporal coherence.\n\n\\subsection{Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer for Consistent Event Anticipation (HMT-CEA)}\nThe original Consistent Event Anticipation (CEA) employs a standard transformer decoder with a limited look-back window, which may fail to maintain a persistent representation of an ongoing event's gist. Inspired by human cognition—which uses working memory for immediate context and long-term memory for schemas—we propose the HMT-CEA. It maintains two complementary memory structures: a dynamic \\textbf{Main Event Memory ($\\mathbf{M}$)} that captures the abstract, persistent essence of the current event, and a \\textbf{Local Context Cache ($\\mathbf{C}$)} that holds fine-grained recent features.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture and State Update}\nGiven a stream of frame features $\\mathbf{f}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, we first project them into a memory-compatible space: $\\mathbf{h}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{f}_t)$. The HMT-CEA operates recurrently, maintaining states $(\\mathbf{M}_t, \\mathbf{C}_t)$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Local Context Update}: The cache $\\mathbf{C}_t$ is a FIFO queue of the last $L$ projected features: $\\mathbf{C}_t = [\\mathbf{h}_{t-L}, ..., \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}]$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Main Memory Gated Update}: The core memory $\\mathbf{M}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ is updated via a gated mechanism using the new observation $\\mathbf{h}_t$ and previous context.\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g [\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}; \\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t; \\mathbf{h}_t] + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t = \\text{TransformerBlock}(\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_t, \\mathbf{h}_t)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{M}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{M}}_t + (1 - \\mathbf{g}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\n    \\]\n    where $\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}_t$ is the mean-pooled cache, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\\text{TransformerBlock}$ is a lightweight cross-attention module that allows the memory to attend to the local context and new input.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Next-Frame Prediction}: The anticipated feature for frame $t$ is generated by fusing information from both memory levels:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{z}_t = \\text{Decoder}( \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{C}_{t-1} )\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_t = \\text{Linear}(\\mathbf{z}_t)\n    \\]\n    Here, $\\text{Decoder}$ is a small autoregressive transformer that uses $\\mathbf{M}_{t-1}$ as a persistent query and $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ as keys and values, ensuring causality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis architecture ensures predictions are grounded in both the immediate past ($\\mathbf{C}$) and a stable, evolving representation of the current event ($\\mathbf{M}$).\n\n\\subsection{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nInstead of a single scalar error, we define a multi-dimensional error vector $\\mathbf{E}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that captures different facets of prediction inconsistency, yielding a more robust boundary detection signal.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error ($E^{(r)}_t$)}: The primary discrepancy, analogous to the original $\\epsilon_t$, but computed in the projected space for stability.\n    \\[\n    E^{(r)}_t = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{h}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{z}_t}{\\|\\mathbf{h}_t\\| \\|\\mathbf{z}_t\\|}\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error ($E^{(s)}_t$)}: Measures inconsistency between consecutive predictions. Within a consistent event, predictions should vary smoothly.\n    \\[\n    E^{(s)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|_2 - \\beta \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{h}_t - \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\\|_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\beta$ is a scaling factor. This term becomes large only when predictions are jagged despite smooth actual changes.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error ($E^{(m)}_t$)}: Quantifies the impact of the new frame on the main event memory, reflecting a potential high-level schema violation.\n    \\[\n    E^{(m)}_t = \\|\\mathbf{M}_t - \\mathbf{M}_{t-1}\\|_1\n    \\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe final SMPE vector is the concatenation: $\\mathbf{E}_t = [E^{(r)}_t, E^{(s)}_t, E^{(m)}_t]^\\top$. This structured error is more informative and less noisy than a scalar counterpart.\n\n\\subsection{Training with Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}\nThe HMT-CEA is trained by minimizing a novel \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)}, which jointly optimizes prediction accuracy and the temporal structural properties implied by EST.\n\n\\subsubsection{Boundary-Aware Focal Reconstruction Loss}\nWe adapt binary cross-entropy to address class imbalance and hard examples using the primary error $E^{(r)}_t$:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{Focal}(E^{(r)}_t, y_t) = - \\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma y_t \\log(p_t) - (1 - \\alpha) p_t^\\gamma (1 - y_t) \\log(1 - p_t)\n\\]\nwhere $p_t = \\text{sigmoid}(-\\lambda \\cdot E^{(r)}_t + b)$, $\\lambda$ and $b$ are learnable parameters, $y_t$ is the boundary label, $\\alpha$ balances class frequency, and $\\gamma$ focuses on hard examples.\n\n\\subsubsection{Temporal Coherence Regularization}\nThis unsupervised loss enforces two structural properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Prediction Smoothness}: Within non-boundary segments ($y_t=0$), predictions should be smooth:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{N}|} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\|\\mathbf{z}_t - \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of non-boundary frames.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Intra-event Feature Clustering}: All predictions within a ground-truth event segment should cluster in embedding space:\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster} = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\frac{1}{|I_s|} \\sum_{i \\in I_s} \\|\\mathbf{z}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s\\|^2_2\n    \\]\n    where $S$ is the number of events in a clip, $I_s$ is the set of frame indices in event $s$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s$ is the mean of $\\mathbf{z}_i$ for $i \\in I_s$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe total SCL is: $\\mathcal{L}_{SCL} = \\mathcal{L}_{Focal} + \\lambda_s \\mathcal{L}_{Smooth} + \\lambda_c \\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$.\n\n\\subsection{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)}\nThe AMTD replaces the heuristic online boundary detector (OBD) with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) that learns to detect boundaries from the sequence of SMPE vectors $\\{\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t\\}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Architecture}\nThe AMTD, denoted $\\mathcal{D}_\\phi$, comprises:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-scale Feature Extraction}: Parallel 1D convolutions with kernel sizes $k_1, k_2, k_3$ capture short-, medium-, and long-range temporal patterns in $\\mathbf{E}_t$:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{s}^{(i)}_t = \\text{ReLU}(\\text{Conv1D}_{k_i}([\\mathbf{E}_{t-\\Delta}, ..., \\mathbf{E}_t]))\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Dynamic Fusion}: Multi-scale features are concatenated and weighted adaptively via self-attention:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{S}_t = [\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(2)}_t, \\mathbf{s}^{(3)}_t], \\quad \\mathbf{A}_t = \\text{SelfAttention}(\\mathbf{S}_t)\n    \\]\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Boundary Probability Estimation}: The attended feature produces the final online boundary probability:\n    \\[\n    P_t^{boundary} = \\sigma(\\text{MLP}(\\text{Pool}(\\mathbf{A}_t)))\n    \\]\n    A boundary is declared if $P_t^{boundary} > 0.5$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsubsection{Online Operation and Training}\nDuring online inference, AMTD slides over the streaming SMPE vectors using a FIFO buffer of size $\\Delta+1$. It is trained jointly with the HMT-CEA via SCL, where binary labels $y_t$ supervise $P_t^{boundary}$ through a standard cross-entropy loss, forming a fully differentiable, end-to-end optimizable system for online granular event boundary detection (On-GEBD).\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\subsubsection{Benchmark Datasets.}\nWe evaluate our method on two established benchmarks for generic event boundary detection (GEBD). The \\textbf{Kinetics-GEBD} dataset is derived from the Kinetics-400 dataset, comprising approximately 60K videos. Each video is annotated with taxonomy-free event boundaries, containing about five events on average. The dataset is officially split into training (18,794 videos), validation (18,813 videos), and test (17,725 videos) sets. As test set annotations are withheld, we report results on the validation set, consistent with prior work. For cross-validation in certain analyses, we further split the training data into 80\\% for training and 20\\% for validation. The \\textbf{TAPOS} dataset consists of Olympic sports videos originally annotated for action localization. Following the standard adaptation for GEBD, we repurpose it by discarding action labels and treating sub-action boundaries as generic event boundaries. This results in 13,094 training and 1,790 validation action instances.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evaluation Metric.}\nWe adopt the standard Relative Distance (Rel.Dis) metric for GEBD. For a predicted boundary timestamp and its corresponding ground truth, the relative distance is computed as their temporal offset divided by the duration of the union of the predicted and ground-truth event instances. Following common practice, when multiple consecutive frames are predicted as boundaries, the central frame is taken as the final timestamp. Performance is evaluated under ten Rel.Dis thresholds from 0.05 to 0.5 with a step size of 0.05. A prediction is considered correct if its Rel.Dis is below a given threshold. We report the F1 score at each threshold and the average F1 score across all thresholds.\n\n\\subsubsection{Baselines.}\nEstablishing baselines for Online GEBD (On-GEBD) is non-trivial as standard offline GEBD methods are not designed for streaming input. Therefore, we adapt state-of-the-art models from related online video understanding tasks. From Online Action Detection, we adapt TeSTra, OadTR, and MiniROAD. From Online Temporal Action Localization, we adapt Sim-On. For a fair comparison, we modify only the final layer of each model to perform binary classification (boundary vs. non-boundary), denoted with the suffix '-BC'. We also compare against a dedicated online GEBD method, \\textbf{ESTimator}. Furthermore, to contextualize our online performance, we include comparisons with leading offline GEBD methods.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implementation Details.}\nOur proposed method, \\textbf{ESTimator++}, is implemented using standard video features for fair comparison. Videos are sampled at 24 FPS for Kinetics-GEBD and 6 FPS for TAPOS. We use 2048-dimensional features extracted by an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 encoder. The Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) employs a main memory with dimension $d_m=512$ and a local context cache of size $L=16$. The Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) uses temporal convolutional kernels of sizes $[3, 7, 15]$. The model is trained end-to-end for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $1\\times10^{-4}$, a batch size of 512, and loss weights $\\lambda_s=0.1$ and $\\lambda_c=0.05$.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison with Online Baselines}\nTable~\\ref{tab:online_k400} and Table~\\ref{tab:online_tapos} present the online detection performance on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS validation sets, respectively.\n\nOn Kinetics-GEBD (Table~\\ref{tab:online_k400}), \\textbf{ESTimator++} sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming all online baselines across all Rel.Dis thresholds. Traditional online models like TeSTra-BC and Sim-On-BC show limited effectiveness for this task. While MiniROAD-BC and the prior dedicated method ESTimator perform better, our method achieves a superior average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}. This represents an improvement of +3.0\\% over ESTimator and +9.7\\% over MiniROAD-BC, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed architectural components.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Quantitative comparison with online baselines on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set.

We profile the average inference time per frame on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:efficiency}, \\textbf{ESTimator++} processes frames at \\textbf{8.2 ms (∼122 FPS)}, which is significantly faster than the real-time requirement of 24 FPS for the Kinetics dataset. Although it is understandably slower than the simpler ESTimator and some lightweight baselines like TeSTra-BC, its runtime is still an order of magnitude lower than the total latency of offline methods, which must process entire clips. This demonstrates that \\textbf{ESTimator++} successfully balances state-of-the-art accuracy with practical online inference speed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of inference efficiency (lower time per frame is better).

This can be attributed to the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) providing a cleaner signal and the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) learning to distinguish true boundary patterns from noise. Furthermore, in sequences with gradual transitions, \\textbf{ESTimator++} shows improved temporal localization, likely due to the multi-scale receptive field of the AMTD. These observations align with its superior quantitative performance.\n\n\\section{Ablation Studies}\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the Kinetics-GEBD validation set to validate the contribution of each component in \\textbf{ESTimator++}. All experiments follow the implementation details in Section~\\ref{sec:setup}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Impact of Proposed Components}\nWe start from a baseline model that uses a standard Transformer decoder for prediction and a single reconstruction error with a fixed heuristic threshold for detection. This baseline achieves an average F1 score of 0.715. We then sequentially integrate our proposed components, with results summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_components}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation study on the contribution of each proposed component.

Replacing the single error with the \\textbf{Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)} yields a further gain of +2.1\\%, confirming that a composite error signal provides richer boundary cues. Employing the \\textbf{Structural Consistency Loss (SCL)} for training adds another +1.5\\%, validating that enforcing intra-event smoothness and feature clustering shapes more discriminative representations. Finally, substituting the heuristic threshold with the learned \\textbf{Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD)} provides the most substantial single-module improvement of +2.9\\%, underscoring the advantage of a data-driven decision function. The full model integrating all components achieves the best performance of \\textbf{0.778}, confirming their synergistic effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{Analysis of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE)}\nWe analyze the contribution of each error view within the SMPE by ablating them individually from the full model. Results are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_smpe}. Removing the \\textbf{Predictive Smoothness Error} causes the most significant drop (-1.7\\% in Avg F1), highlighting its sensitivity to event transitions. Omitting the \\textbf{Memory Perturbation Error} leads to a -1.2\\% decrease, demonstrating the importance of tracking high-level event schema changes. Removing the primary \\textbf{Feature Reconstruction Error} also degrades performance (-1.0\\%). Using any single error view consistently underperforms compared to the full SMPE vector, validating our composite design.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE).

Results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_amtd}. Replacing the AMTD with the original heuristic Online Boundary Detector (OBD) causes a performance drop to 0.748. Using a \\textbf{single-scale} Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) instead of the multi-scale architecture reduces Avg F1 to 0.771. Removing the \\textbf{self-attention based dynamic fusion} and simply concatenating multi-scale features results in a score of 0.774. These ablations confirm that each aspect of the AMTD's design—its learned nature, multi-scale perception, and adaptive fusion—contributes to its effectiveness.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the design of the Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD).

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation_loss}, training with only the \\textbf{Focal Reconstruction Loss} yields a baseline score of 0.754. Adding the \\textbf{Intra-event Smoothness Loss} improves performance to 0.766. Further incorporating the \\textbf{Intra-event Clustering Loss} to form the full SCL pushes the score to 0.769. The full SCL, combining both regularizers, delivers the best result, confirming that jointly optimizing for local accuracy and global temporal coherence is an effective strategy.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation on the components of the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL). The HMT and SMPE are used in all variants.

The hierarchical memory (HMT) establishes a robust predictive foundation, the structured error (SMPE) extracts optimal boundary cues, the consistency loss (SCL) shapes the learning objective, and the adaptive discriminator (AMTD) makes precise online decisions. The full model's superior performance arises from their seamless integration.\n\n\\section{Evaluation}\n\\subsection{Training Dynamics and Convergence Analysis}\nTo gain deeper insights into the optimization behavior of \\textbf{ESTimator++}, we analyze its training dynamics. The training and validation loss curves over 30 epochs on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset show that \\textbf{ESTimator++} converges more smoothly and stably to a lower final loss compared to its predecessor \\textbf{ESTimator} and the strong baseline \\textbf{MiniROAD-BC}. This indicates that the Structural Consistency Loss (SCL) provides a more stable gradient signal. Furthermore, the gap between training and validation loss for \\textbf{ESTimator++} remains consistently narrow, suggesting strong generalization and reduced overfitting, a benefit likely attributable to the regularizing effects of $\\mathcal{L}_{Smooth}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Cluster}$. In contrast, the baseline models exhibit more pronounced fluctuations and a larger generalization gap.\n\n\\subsection{In-depth Case Study}\nWe conduct a systematic case study to examine \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s performance across diverse scenarios. We categorize sequences from the Kinetics-GEBD validation set into groups such as \\textit{‘fast-paced action transitions’}, \\textit{‘gradual scene changes’}, and \\textit{‘static periods with subtle motions’}. For each category, we compare the SMPE signal and final boundary predictions from \\textbf{ESTimator++} against those from \\textbf{ESTimator} and \\textbf{TeSTra-BC}. In fast-paced sequences, \\textbf{ESTimator++}'s AMTD demonstrates superior ability to isolate closely spaced peaks, leading to precise detection of sequential boundaries. For gradual transitions, the multi-view SMPE provides a rising error signal over several frames, which the multi-scale AMTD effectively integrates to produce a confident prediction. During static periods, \\textbf{ESTimator++} exhibits significantly lower spurious activation due to the intra-event smoothness constraint. These observations concretely explain the quantitative improvements shown in the main results.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis paper addresses the task of Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD). We propose \\textbf{ESTimator++}, an enhanced framework that provides a deeper computational implementation of the Event Segmentation Theory (EST). It integrates three key innovations: a Hierarchical Memory-augmented Transformer (HMT) for robust event anticipation, a Structured Multi-view Prediction Error (SMPE) for richer boundary cues, and an Adaptive Multi-scale Temporal Discriminator (AMTD) for learning boundary decisions. These components are trained end-to-end using a novel Structural Consistency Loss (SCL).\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the Kinetics-GEBD dataset, \\textbf{ESTimator++} achieves a state-of-the-art average F1 score of \\textbf{0.778}, significantly outperforming all existing online baselines, including its predecessor ESTimator (0.748). Similarly, on the TAPOS dataset, it attains a leading average F1 score of \\textbf{0.569}. Notably, our online method performs competitively against many powerful offline models, securing the third-highest overall ranking on both benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, with AMTD yielding the most substantial gain as a single module. Furthermore, \\textbf{ESTimator++} maintains a practical inference time of 8.2ms per frame, making it suitable for real-time processing.\n\nIn summary, \\textbf{ESTimator++} establishes a new state-of-the-art for On-GEBD by effectively translating cognitive principles into a synergistic neural architecture. It delivers highly accurate boundary detection with low latency, paving the way for more sophisticated real-time video understanding systems. Future work could explore extending this framework to more complex, long-form video streams and multi-modal inputs.\n\n\\end{document}\n\nPlease generate a professional image generation prompt according to the figure type."
