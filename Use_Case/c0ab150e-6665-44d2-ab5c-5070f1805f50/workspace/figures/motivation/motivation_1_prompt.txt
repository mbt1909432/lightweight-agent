A professional, academic motivation figure for a NeurIPS-style paper on Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), illustrating the core motivation by contrasting offline vs. online processing and highlighting the inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory (EST). The figure is a clean, intuitive visualization with two main horizontal panels side-by-side for clear comparison, using a minimalistic style with sharp lines, ample white space, and high contrast for easy understanding. Overall layout: top title "Motivation for Online Generic Event Boundary Detection" in bold Arial font, size 14; subtitles in Arial font, size 12; all labels in Arial font, size 10, black text for readability.

Left panel (50% width, labeled "Offline GEBD: Full Video Context"): Depict a horizontal timeline of a video stream with 10 sequential abstract frames (simple icons like a person jumping, then landing, then walking, representing action transitions). Show bidirectional arrows across the entire timeline indicating access to past, present, and future frames (blue arrows for past/future, green for present). Mark 3-4 event boundaries with vertical dashed red lines, and overlay a smooth curve below representing low-variance boundary detection signals. Emphasize global context with a semi-transparent blue overlay covering the whole timeline. Caption below: "Offline methods use full past, present, and future context for accurate but non-real-time boundary detection."

Right panel (50% width, labeled "Online GEBD: Streaming, Causal Processing"): Show the same video timeline but as a streaming sequence, with frames arriving from left to right; past frames in full color, current frame highlighted in green, future frames grayed out and inaccessible (with a lock icon). Use unidirectional arrows (orange for data flow) pointing rightward, indicating real-time processing without future access. Mark boundaries with vertical dashed red lines detected only up to the current frame, and overlay a jagged curve below representing prediction error spikes (in red) at boundaries, inspired by EST. Emphasize challenges with subtle transitions shown as faint frame changes and a question mark on future frames. Caption below: "Online methods mimic human cognition (EST): predict based on past/present only, detecting boundaries via prediction errors in real-time, but face challenges like limited context and subtle transitions."

Bottom section (spanning both panels): A small conceptual diagram of EST with a stylized brain icon on the left, connected by an arrow to a prediction module showing "Predicted Frame" vs. "Actual Frame"; low error (green checkmark) inside an event segment, high error (red exclamation) at a boundary, leading to event segmentation. Use contrasting colors: blue tones for offline elements, orange/red tones for online challenges and errors, green for successful predictions. Ensure the figure is visually balanced, easy to interpret at a glance, with no clutter, suitable for black-and-white printing but enhanced with color for emphasis.
